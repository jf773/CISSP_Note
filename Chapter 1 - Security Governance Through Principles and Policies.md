# **Answer Key and Explanations**

Below are the correct answers for each question plus rationale. The explanation includes why the correct answer is correct and why the others are less correct.

---

## 1. CIA Triad
1. **Correct Answer: C (Availability)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** A DoS attack targets the availability of resources.  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - A (Confidentiality): DoS doesn’t typically reveal secrets.  
     - B (Integrity): DoS focuses on disruption, not changing data.  
     - D (Nonrepudiation): This principle focuses on denying or attributing actions, not relevant to DoS.

2. **Correct Answer: B (Integrity)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** Hashing verifies data hasn’t been altered, thus protecting integrity.  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - A (Availability): Hashing doesn’t keep a system running; it just detects changes.  
     - C (Confidentiality): Hashes don’t encrypt data.  
     - D (Accountability): Accountability is about linking actions to users, not verifying file content.

3. **Correct Answer: D (Availability)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** Overly restricted access can prevent legitimate use, harming availability.  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - A (Integrity): No direct sign of data corruption.  
     - B (Confidentiality): They have confidentiality, possibly too much.  
     - C (Nonrepudiation): Not indicated here.

---

## 2. DAD Triad
1. **Correct Answer: A (Disclosure)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** Unauthorized read access is a confidentiality failure, i.e., “disclosure.”  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - B (Destruction): Data not destroyed.  
     - C (Availability): The question doesn’t indicate service disruption.  
     - D (Alteration): No mention of data being modified.

2. **Correct Answer: B (Alteration)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** Corrupting essential files modifies them without authorization, i.e., “alteration.”  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - A (Disclosure): Reading data, not relevant here.  
     - C (Destruction): Data is corrupted, but not necessarily destroyed.  
     - D (Nonrepudiation): Not part of DAD.

3. **Correct Answer: C (DAD represents the negative outcomes if CIA protections fail)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** DAD shows the inverse of CIA: Disclosure (C fail), Alteration (I fail), Destruction (A fail).  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - A (Physical vs. logical) is not correct.  
     - B (Alternate name) is incorrect; DAD is a negative outcome.  
     - D (Government classification) is irrelevant.

---

## 3. AAA Services
1. **Correct Answer: B (Authorization)**  
   - **Explanation (Correct):** Authorization defines allowable resources after successful authentication.  
   - **Why Others Are Wrong:**  
     - A (Authentication) verifies identity, not resource assignment.  
     - C (Accounting) is logging.
