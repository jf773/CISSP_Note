## Asymmetric Cryptography  

Modern information security hinges on **public-key (asymmetric) algorithms** to solve the key-distribution problem that plagues symmetric ciphers. In an asymmetric scheme every entity owns a **key pair**: one key to share üí° (the *public* key) and one to guard üîí (the *private* key).

### Public and Private Keys  

| Property | Public Key | Private Key |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Visibility | Freely distributed (certificates, key servers, QR codes) | Kept secret‚Äîoften inside an HSM, TPM, or smart card |
| Main Uses | **Encrypt** for confidentiality, **verify** signatures | **Decrypt** incoming data, **sign** outgoing data |
| Security Concern | Authenticity (is it really Alice‚Äôs?) | Confidentiality (must never leak) |

*üß† Exam cues:*  
* ‚ÄúEncrypt with recipient‚Äôs ***public*** key‚Äù ‚Üí only recipient can decrypt.  
* ‚ÄúSign with sender‚Äôs ***private*** key‚Äù ‚Üí anyone can verify authenticity & non-repudiation with sender‚Äôs public key.

### RSA  

* **Security principle:** Hardness of factoring a large composite \(n = p \times q\).  
* **Key generation steps (simplified):**  
  1. Pick two random ~2048-bit primes \(p, q\).  
  2. Compute \(n = p \times q\) and \(\phi(n) = (p-1)(q-1)\).  
  3. Choose public exponent \(e\) where \(1 < e < \phi(n)\) and \(\gcd(e,\phi(n)) = 1\) (65537 is common).  
  4. Find private exponent \(d\) such that \(e \times d \equiv 1 \;(\mathrm{mod}\;\phi(n))\).  
* **Operations:**  
  * Encryption: \(C = P^{e} \bmod n\)  
  * Decryption / Signature generation: \(P = C^{d} \bmod n\)  
* **Strength guidelines (NIST SP 800-57):**  
  * 2048-bit RSA ‚âà 112-bit symmetric strength (good to ~2030).  
  * 3072-bit RSA ‚âà 128-bit symmetric strength (good beyond 2030).

**Pros:** Mature, widely supported (TLS, SSH, PGP, S/MIME).  
**Cons:** Slow, large keys/ciphertexts; vulnerable to **quantum** factoring (Shor).

### ElGamal  

* Extension of Diffie-Hellman math; relies on the **discrete logarithm problem (DLP)** in a finite field.  
* Generates two-part ciphertext ‚Üí **doubles message size** ‚ö†Ô∏è.

* **Advantages:** Free of historical RSA patents, provides semantic security, supports **forward secrecy** when used ephemerally.  
* **Use cases:** PGP (for key transport), cryptographic libraries where RSA licensing once mattered.

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography

* Security from the **Elliptic-Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)**‚Äîbelieved harder than integer DLP or factoring.  
* **Tiny keys, same strength:**  
  | Symmetric Strength | RSA/DH Key | ECC Key |
  |--------------------|------------|---------|
  | 112-bit | 2048 bits | 224 bits |
  | 128-bit | 3072 bits | 256 bits |
* Common curves: **P-256** (`secp256r1`), **P-384**, **Curve25519**.  
* Major protocols: **ECDSA** (signatures), **ECDH/ECDHE** (key exchange).  
* Perfect for mobile/IoT due to low CPU & battery demand üîã.

### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange  

* Goal: agree on a shared symmetric key over an open channel without sending the key itself.  
* **Classic DH math:**  
  1. Public parameters: prime \(p\) and generator \(g\).  
  2. Alice picks secret \(a\); sends \(A = g^{a} \bmod p\).  
  3. Bob picks secret \(b\); sends \(B = g^{b} \bmod p\).  
  4. Both compute \(K = (other^{secret}) \bmod p\).  
* **Variants:**  
  * **DHE** (ephemeral) ‚Üí forward secrecy.  
  * **ECDHE** ‚Üí uses ECC for speed & shorter keys.  
* **Not** an encryption algorithm by itself‚Äîonly a **key agreement** mechanism.

### Quantum Cryptography  

* **Quantum computing threat:** Shor‚Äôs algorithm could break RSA, DH, ECC in polynomial time ‚è±Ô∏è.  
* **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD):** Uses photon polarization; eavesdropping collapses quantum state ‚Üí immediately detectable.  
* **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):** Lattice-based (CRYSTALS-Kyber), hash-based (SPHINCS+), multivariate, code-based schemes under NIST standardization.  
* **CISSP takeaway:**  
  * Inventory and classify cryptographic assets.  
  * Plan for **crypto agility**‚Äîability to swap algorithms/keys quickly.  
  * Long-term sensitive data (‚ñ∂ 10 years) should already consider PQC readiness.

## Hash Functions  

A **hash function** transforms an input of arbitrary length into a fixed-length **message digest** that uniquely represents the data yet cannot be reversed (one-way). In practice digests are appended to messages or signed to prove **integrity** and **origin**.

### Why Hashes Matter
1. **Integrity check** ‚Äì Receiver re-hashes the message; matching digests ‚áí message unchanged.  
2. **Digital signatures** ‚Äì Instead of signing large data directly, a sender signs the compact digest.  

> **Size note:** Most modern digests are ‚â• 128 bits‚Äîthe longer the digest, the lower the collision risk.

### Five Requirements for a Cryptographic Hash (RSA Security)  
1. **Arbitrary-length input** handled.  
2. **Fixed-length output** produced.  
3. **Efficiency** ‚Äì quick to compute.  
4. **One-way** ‚Äì infeasible to derive the input from the hash.  
5. **Collision resistance** ‚Äì infeasible to find two inputs with the same hash.

### SHA Family  

| Variant | Digest (bits) | Block (bits) | Status (2025) | Notes |
|---------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| **SHA-1** | 160 | 512 | ‚ùå Deprecated | Collisions (‚ÄúSHAttered‚Äù, 2017). |
| **SHA-256** | 256 | 512 | ‚úÖ Secure | SHA-2 family. |
| **SHA-224** | 224 | 512 | ‚úÖ Secure | Truncated SHA-256. |
| **SHA-512** | 512 | 1024 | ‚úÖ Secure | SHA-2 family. |
| **SHA-384** | 384 | 1024 | ‚úÖ Secure | Truncated SHA-512. |
| **SHA-3** (224-512) | 224-512 | Sponge | ‚úÖ Secure | Keccak algorithm; slower in software but drop-in replacement for SHA-2. |

*Memorize the digest sizes*‚Äîa frequent CISSP question.

### MD5  

* Evolved from **MD2** (1989) ‚Üí **MD4** (1990) ‚Üí **MD5** (1992).  
* Processes 512-bit blocks, four rounds, outputs **128-bit** digest.  
* **Broken:** Practical collisions (Lenstra, 2005) allow forged certificates.  
* Acceptable only for non-security uses (e.g., file deduplication), never for signatures or certs.

### RIPEMD  

| Variant | Digest | Security |
|---------|--------|----------|
| RIPEMD | 128 b | Insecure |
| RIPEMD-128 | 128 b | Insecure |
| **RIPEMD-160** | 160 b | ‚úÖ Secure (Bitcoin, open source) |
| RIPEMD-256 | 256 b | Same security as 128 b (insecure) |
| RIPEMD-320 | 320 b | Same security as 160 b (secure) |

> ü§î **Odd fact:** Lengthening the digest (RIPEMD-256) does **not** always increase security.

### Comparison of Hash Function Value Lengths  

| Hash Function | Digest Length (bits) |
|---------------|----------------------|
| HAVAL | 128 / 160 / 192 / 224 / 256 |
| **HMAC** | Variable (depends on underlying hash) |
| MD5 | 128 |
| SHA-1 | 160 |
| SHA2-224 / SHA3-224 | 224 |
| SHA2-256 / SHA3-256 | 256 |
| SHA2-384 / SHA3-384 | 384 |
| SHA2-512 / SHA3-512 | 512 |
| RIPEMD-128 | 128 |
| RIPEMD-160 | 160 |
| RIPEMD-256 | 256 (security ‚âà 128) |
| RIPEMD-320 | 320 (security ‚âà 160) |

### Quick CISSP Takeaways üìå  
* Choose **SHA-256** or stronger for new deployments.  
* MD5 and SHA-1 are **unsuitable** for certificates, signatures, and integrity assurance.  
* Understand digest sizes and which variants are deprecated.  
* Remember the five hash requirements and the dual role of digests in integrity checks and digital signatures.

## Digital Signatures  

Digital signatures glue **hashing** and **public-key cryptography** together to reach three CISSP-critical goals:  

| Crypto Goal | How the Digital Signature Achieves It |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Integrity** üõ°Ô∏è | Receiver re-hashes the message and compares to the signed digest. |
| **Authentication** üîë | Only the **sender‚Äôs private key** could have produced the signature, and everyone can verify it with the sender‚Äôs public key. |
| **Non-repudiation** üìú | The sender cannot credibly deny creating a signature that only their private key could have generated. |

**Core workflow (Alice ‚ûî Bob):**  
1. Alice hashes the plaintext (e.g., SHA-512) ‚Üí digest.  
2. Alice encrypts that digest with **her private key** ‚Üí digital signature.  
3. She appends the signature to the plaintext (or encrypts the whole bundle with Bob‚Äôs public key for confidentiality).  
4. Bob decrypts the signature with **Alice‚Äôs public key**, hashes the received plaintext, and compares digests. Match ‚áí authentic, intact.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Key-selection cheat sheet**  
> * Encrypt confidential data? **Recipient‚Äôs public key**  
> * Decrypt confidential data sent to you? **Your private key**  
> * Sign data? **Your private key**  
> * Verify signature? **Sender‚Äôs public key**

### HMAC  

**H**ash-based **M**essage **A**uthentication **C**ode is a *symmetric* alternative that mixes any standard hash (MD5, SHA-2, SHA-3, etc.) with a **shared secret key**.

| Feature | HMAC | Full Digital Signature (RSA / ECDSA / EdDSA) |
|---------|------|----------------------------------------------|
| Integrity | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| Authentication | ‚úÖ (to those who know the key) | ‚úÖ |
| Non-repudiation | ‚ùå (shared key) | ‚úÖ |
| Keys Used | One shared secret | Public / private pair |
| Performance | Very fast ‚ö° | Slower (asymmetric math) |

*Use cases:* VPN tunnels, TLS record MACs, API tokens‚Äîwhere both parties already share a secret and do **not** need non-repudiation.

### Digital Signature Standard  

NIST **FIPS 186-5** (a.k.a. DSS) lists U.S.-approved signature algorithms **and mandates SHA-3** hash functions for new federal systems.

| Algorithm | Key Type | Strength Notes | Typical Key Size | Highlights |
|-----------|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **RSA** (RFC 8017) | Integer factoring | Mature, widespread | ‚â• 2048 bits | Simple validation, large keys |
| **ECDSA** (FIPS 186-5) | Elliptic curve | Equivalent strength with tiny keys | 256 bits (P-256) | Good for IoT / mobile |
| **EdDSA** (RFC 8032) | Edwards-curve | Deterministic, side-channel-resistant | Ed25519 / Ed448 | Very fast verification |

*Exam tips:*  
* DSS does **not** approve DSA with SHA-1 anymore‚ÄîSHA-3 only.  
* ECDSA & EdDSA inherently support non-repudiation.  
* When speed and small keys matter, expect a test answer pointing to **ECDSA** or **EdDSA** over RSA.

## Public Key Infrastructure  

A **PKI** is a hierarchy of trust that links verified identities to public keys via **digital certificates**.  
Result: strangers can bootstrap secure (hybrid) communication by trusting the certificate chain instead of pre-sharing secrets.

### Certificates  

* **Standard:** ITU-T **X.509**.  
* **Key fields (memorize!):** Version, **Serial Number**, Signature Algorithm, **Issuer**, **Validity**, **Subject**, **Subject Public Key Info**, Extensions.  
* **Wildcard** certs (`*.example.org`) cover one sub-domain level only.  
* Use cases: server TLS, e-mail, code signing, device authentication.  

| Certificate Type | Identity Vetting | Typical Use | Example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Domain Validation (DV)** | Proves control of domain | Basic HTTPS | letsencrypt.org |
| **Organization Validation (OV)** | Confirms legal entity | Enterprise apps | digicert.com |
| **Extended Validation (EV)** | Rigorous legal + operational checks | High-trust sites (banking) | green bar (legacy) |

### Certificate Authorities  

* **Root CA** (offline) ‚Üí **Intermediate CAs** (online) ‚Üí **End-entity certs**. This chaining lets the root‚Äôs private key stay powered-off üí°.  
* **Registration Authority (RA):** performs identity checks on behalf of a CA.  
* Trust model: browsers ship with a root store; anything signed down that chain is implicitly trusted.  
* Organizations may run an **internal CA** for intranet certificates (= self-signed root trusted only inside).  

> **Risk note:** A single sloppy CA can poison the trust chain (e.g., Symantec 2017 ‚ûî sold to DigiCert).

### Certificate Life Cycle  

| Phase | Key Activities | CISSP Focus |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| **Enrollment** | Prove identity ‚ûî submit **CSR** ‚ûî CA issues & signs cert | DV vs EV requirements |
| **Operation / Use** | Install cert; peers validate chain and check revocation | PIN certs (HPKP deprecated) |
| **Renewal** | Obtain new cert before expiry; may reuse keys or generate fresh | Plan automation |
| **Revocation** | CA marks cert invalid before expiry (compromise, name change, etc.) | CRL, OCSP, stapling |
| **Expiration & Destruction** | Cert naturally expires; keys securely destroyed or archived | Enforce key-destruction policy |

#### Revocation Mechanisms  

| Method | How It Works | Latency | Load | Notes |
|--------|--------------|---------|------|-------|
| **CRL** | Client downloads CA-signed list of revoked serial #s | High (list refresh) | Low CA load | Periodic polling |
| **OCSP** | Client queries CA‚Äôs OCSP responder for real-time status | Low | High CA load | Response: good / revoked / unknown |
| **OCSP Stapling** | Server caches signed OCSP response ‚è≤Ô∏è (e.g., 24 h) and ‚Äústaples‚Äù it to TLS handshake | Very low | Minimal CA load | Modern TLS default |

### Certificate Formats  

| Format | Encoding | File Ext. | Contains | Typical Platform |
|--------|----------|-----------|----------|------------------|
| **DER** | Binary ASN.1 | `.der`, `.crt`, `.cer` | Single cert | Java, appliances |
| **PEM** | Base64 (ASCII) | `.pem`, `.crt` | Cert, chain, or key | Unix/Linux, OpenSSL |
| **PFX / PKCS #12** | Binary container (password-protected) | `.pfx`, `.p12` | Cert **+** private key | Windows import/export |
| **P7B / PKCS #7** | Base64 (ASCII) | `.p7b` | Cert or chain (no private key) | Windows/IIS |

*Remember:* `.crt` may be PEM **or** DER‚Äîinspect the file (BEGIN/END == PEM). üîç

## Asymmetric Key Management  

Good crypto is more than math‚Äîit‚Äôs also **key hygiene**. Follow these best-practice pillars:

| Control | Why It Matters | CISSP Pointers |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Algorithm choice** | Public, peer-reviewed algorithms only (RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA). ‚ÄúBlack-box‚Äù ‚â° üö©. | Security through obscurity ‚â† security. |
| **Key length & randomness** | Longer keys ‚Üî stronger, but slower. Use FIPS / NIST tables; derive keys from **true random** or NIST-approved DRBG. | Avoid pattern bias that aids attacks. |
| **Private-key secrecy** | Exposure ‚ûî irreversible compromise & impersonation. | Store in HSMs, TPMs, smart cards; never share. |
| **Rotation / retirement** | Limits window of undetected compromise. | Enforce policy (e.g., 1‚Äì3 yrs) ‚è≥. |
| **Backup / escrow** | Loss of key = loss of access. | Split knowledge + dual control; encrypt escrow storage. |
| **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** | Tamper-resistant chip that generates, stores, and uses keys without revealing them. | Adds hardware acceleration & audit logs. |

## Hybrid Cryptography  

Combine the **speed** of symmetric with the **scalable key exchange** of asymmetric.

1. Parties negotiate a public-key method (e.g., ECDHE).  
2. They use it once to agree on a random **ephemeral symmetric key**.  
3. All bulk data travels under fast symmetric encryption (AES, ChaCha20).  
4. Session ends ‚Üí key discarded üóëÔ∏è (perfect forward secrecy).

**TLS 1.3** is the textbook example.

| Step | Handshake Action (simplified) |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | ClientHello ‚Üí lists supported cipher suites |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | ServerHello + cert ‚Üí selects suite, sends public key |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ | Both compute shared secret via ECDHE |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ | Derive session keys; switch to symmetric encryption |

## Applied Cryptography  

### Portable Devices üì±  

* **Full-Disk / File Encryption:** BitLocker, FileVault, VeraCrypt.  
* **TPM chip** guards keys & ties them to boot measurements.  
* Mobile OSs (iOS, Android) provide hardware-backed AES-XTS or ChaCha20; mandate passcode/PIN to unlock keys.  
* Evaluate: key protection in RAM, FDE vs FBE, remote wipe support.

### Email ‚úâÔ∏è  

| Need | Technique | Tool / Standard |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Confidentiality | Encrypt message | PGP, S/MIME |
| Integrity & Authn | Hash + Sign | PGP sig, S/MIME |
| Non-repudiation | Digital signature | PGP, S/MIME |
| All of the above | Encrypt **and** sign | PGP (OpenPGP) or S/MIME |

* **PGP / OpenPGP** ‚Äì web-of-trust, hybrid encryption.  
* **S/MIME** ‚Äì X.509 PKI, RSA/ECDH keys, built into Outlook, Apple Mail, Gmail Enterprise+.  
* Sender chooses: encrypt, sign, or both (cost vs need).

### Web Applications üåê  

* **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** replaced SSL.  
* **Secure versions:** 1.2 (minimum) & 1.3 (preferred).  
* TLS 1.3 defaults: ECDHE for key exchange, AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 bulk ciphers, SHA-256/384 for MAC.  
* **POODLE** & other attacks killed SSL 3.0 fallback.  
* **Cipher suite notation:** `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` (bulk cipher + MAC).  
* **Certificate pinning / HSTS** defend against rogue CAs & downgrade.

### Steganography and Watermarking üñºÔ∏è  

| Concept | How It Works | Use Cases | Risks |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **Steganography** | Hide data in LSBs of images/audio/video or within text (concealment cipher). | Covert channels, espionage. | Hard to detect visually; tools exist to scan. |
| **Watermarking** | Embed owner/serial info invisibly. | IP protection, leak tracing. | Must survive format changes. |

### Networking üîí  

#### Link vs End-to-End Encryption  

| Feature | **Link Encryption** | **End-to-End Encryption** |
|---------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| OSI Layer | 1‚Äì2 | 4‚Äì7 |
| Encrypts headers? | Yes ‚Üí every hop decrypts/re-encrypts | No (payload only) |
| Example | IPSec **tunnel** mode | TLS, SSH |

#### Protocol Highlights  

* **SSH-2** ‚Äì Diffie-Hellman / Ed25519 keys, SFTP, channel multiplexing.  
* **IPSec**  
  * Components: **AH** (integrity, auth) + **ESP** (confidentiality, integrity).  
  * Modes: **Transport** (payload only) vs **Tunnel** (entire packet).  
  * **Security Association (SA)** = one-way channel; two SAs per duplex connection.

### Emerging Applications üöÄ  

| Area | Crypto Role | Key Points |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Blockchain** | Distributed, immutable ledger | ECDSA/EdDSA signatures, PoW/PoS consensus. |
| **Lightweight Crypto** | Power-constrained or low-latency devices | Custom ASICs/FPGAs, NIST ‚ÄúLW-C‚Äù project (e.g., Ascon). |
| **Homomorphic Encryption** | Compute on ciphertexts without decrypting | Enables privacy-preserving analytics; still CPU-heavy. |

## Cryptographic Attacks  

Below are the attack patterns CISSP expects you to recognize, the weak point they exploit, and the classic counter-measure.

| Attack Type | Target / Principle | Exam-Ready Countermeasure |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Brute force** | Tries every key üôà | Use long, random keys; lockout/delay mechanisms |
| **Rainbow table** | Pre-computed hash lists | Salt + key-stretch (PBKDF2, bcrypt, scrypt) |
| **Analytic** | Algebraic shortcut of algorithm | Peer-reviewed, publicly vetted ciphers |
| **Implementation** | Bugs / poor coding (not math) | Secure coding, patching, formal verification |
| **Statistical** | Poor RNG or bias | Use NIST-approved CSPRNG |
| **Fault injection** | Voltage, temp, laser fault to leak keys | Tamper-resistant HSMs, sensors, self-wipe |
| **Side-channel** | Power, EM, timing leakage | Constant-time code, shielding, noise injection |
| **Timing** | Measures op duration (variant of side-channel) | Equalize code paths, blinding in RSA/ECDSA |
| **Frequency analysis** (ciphertext-only) | Letter distribution in simple ciphers | Use modern polyalphabetic / block ciphers |
| **Known plaintext** | Have P + C pair | Use strong ciphers (AES, ChaCha20) |
| **Chosen plaintext** | Attacker feeds chosen P | Resistant designs (AES, modern block modes) |
| **Chosen ciphertext** | Oracle decrypts attacker‚Äôs C | Padding-proof modes (OAEP, GCM) |
| **Meet-in-the-middle** | Two-round encryption (e.g., 2DES) | Use ‚â•3 rounds (3DES, AES) |
| **Man-in-the-middle (MITM)** | Spoofs handshake, uses 2 keys | Mutual auth, certificates, pinning |
| **Birthday / collision** | Dual input with same hash | Long hash (‚â• 256 b), collision-resistant algos |
| **Replay** | Re-sends captured packet | Timestamps, nonces, one-time tokens |

üî• **Key concept:** every extra key bit doubles brute-force time; secure design = algorithm strength √ó flawless implementation √ó sound key management.

## Summary  

* **Asymmetric cryptography** enables scalable, trustable communication between strangers using public/private key pairs and PKI-issued certificates.  
* **Digital signatures** merge hashing + asymmetric encryption to supply integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.  
* **Key management** best practices (strong algorithms, secret private keys, rotation, HSMs) keep crypto durable over time.  
* **Hybrid cryptography** (e.g., TLS 1.3) marries asymmetric key exchange with fast symmetric bulk encryption for real-world performance.  
* **Applied crypto** secures data at rest (BitLocker, FileVault), email (PGP, S/MIME), web (TLS), networks (IPSec, SSH), and newer arenas like blockchain, lightweight IoT, and homomorphic analytics.  
* **Attack landscape** spans brute-force, analytic, implementation, side-channel, MITM, replay, and collision methods‚Äîdefense requires sound algorithms, sufficient key sizes, hardened implementations, and vigilant operational controls.

Master these principles and you‚Äôll spot weak crypto ‚Äî and pick the right fix ‚Äî on the CISSP exam and in the field. üöÄ
