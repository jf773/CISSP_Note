## Study Essentials
Identity and Access Management (IAM) üõ°Ô∏è is the domain that **grants, monitors, and revokes** privileges for users, devices, and services.  
Chapter 13 (with Chapter 14) focuses on the **AAA model‚ÄîAuthentication, Authorization, and Accounting**, ensuring that only the right **subjects** reach the right **objects** in a verifiable way. Mastery of these fundamentals underpins every control you will see on the CISSP exam.

## Controlling Access to Assets
Access controls protect **tangible** (servers, devices, facilities) and **intangible** (data, intellectual property) assets.

### Controlling Physical and Logical Access
| Control Type | Goal | Typical Examples | CISSP Tip |
|--------------|------|------------------|-----------|
| **Physical** | Block unauthorized entry, secure environment | Fences, gates, locks, CCTV, HVAC, fire suppression | ‚ÄúTouch-able‚Äù controls; detailed in Chapter 10 |
| **Logical**  | Verify identity, limit system/data use    | Passwords, biometrics, ACLs, permissions, encryption | Often called *technical* controls |

> üîç **Remember:** Physical controls protect the hardware that logical controls depend on. Both are tested together.

### The CIA Triad and Access Controls
| Principle | What Access Controls Prevent | Common Exam Keywords |
|-----------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| **Confidentiality** üîí | Unauthorized **viewing** of data | Encryption, need-to-know, classification |
| **Integrity** üß© | Unauthorized **modification** of data/configs | Hashing, version control, change mgmt |
| **Availability** ‚è±Ô∏è | Disruption of **legitimate** access | Redundancy, backups, failover |

## The AAA Model
#### Big Picture
1. **Authentication** ‚Äì Prove identity  
2. **Authorization** ‚Äì Grant appropriate privileges  
3. **Accounting** ‚Äì Record and review activity  

### Identification and Authentication Strategy
* **Identification** = ‚ÄúI am _Alice_‚Äù  
* **Authentication** = ‚ÄúHere is my üîë to prove it‚Äù  
* Both occur together; uniqueness of IDs is essential.  
* Credentials must be protected (e.g., hashed passwords).

### Comparing Subjects and Objects
| Term | Definition | Exam Example |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **Subject** | Active entity requesting data | User, process, service |
| **Object**  | Passive entity containing data | File, DB record, printer |
| **Access**  | Flow of info **object ‚û°Ô∏è subject** | Read a file, query DB |

> Tip: A web app can **switch roles**‚Äîobject when serving pages, subject when pulling a cookie.

### Registration, Proofing, and Establishment of Identity
* **In-person proofing**: passport/ID checked by HR.  
* **Remote proofing**: Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA) questions.  
* **Cognitive passwords** (security questions) are weak‚ÄîNIST discourages static Q&A due to social-media exposure.  
* Biometric enrollment = capture & store reference template.

### Authorization and Accounting
* **Authorization**: Enforces **least privilege**‚Äîpermissions mapped to proven ID.  
* **Accounting**: Audit logs ‚û°Ô∏è non-repudiation & policy compliance.  
  * ‚ÄúAll-or-nothing‚Äù auth vs. *granular* authorization.

### Authentication Factors Overview
| Factor | AKA (legacy) | Typical Methods | Strength |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Something You Know** | Type 1 | Password, PIN, passphrase | Weakest |
| **Something You Have** | Type 2 | Smartcard, OTP token | Medium |
| **Something You Are** | Type 3 | Biometrics (fingerprint, iris) | Strongest |
| *Attributes* | ‚Äî | Somewhere You Are, Context-aware, Something You Do | Adaptive |

*Single-factor* uses one; **MFA** uses ‚â•2 different factors.

---

### Something You Know
* **Passwords** are *static* and vulnerable to brute force, spraying, and credential stuffing.  
* **Passphrases** boost length & memorability.  
* **PINs**: numeric, often used on smartcards or mobile devices.

#### Password Policy Components
| Setting | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Max Age** | Force periodic change (except where NIST says otherwise) |
| **Complexity** | Mix of char types |
| **Length** | ‚â• 8 (NIST); ‚â• 12 (PCI DSS) |
| **Min Age** | Block rapid cycling back to old pw |
| **History** | Remember last _n_ passwords |

#### NIST vs PCI DSS Requirements
| Requirement | **NIST 800-63B** | **PCI DSS 4.0** |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Expiration  | Only if compromised | Every 90 days |
| Min Length  | 8‚Äì64 chars | 12+ chars |
| Special Chars | Not required | Must include alpha & numeric |
| Screen vs common pw list | ‚úÖ | (Not specified) |

### Something You Have
#### Smartcards
* Chip‚Äêenabled ID containing certificates.  
* Require **PIN+card** ‚Üí MFA.

#### Authenticators / Tokens
| Method | Clock? | OTP Lifetime | RFC |
|--------|--------|-------------|-----|
| **TOTP** ‚è≤Ô∏è | Yes | 30-60 s | 6238 |
| **HOTP** üî¢ | No (counter) | Until used | 4226 |

> üí° Hardware failure, loss, or battery death = availability risk.

### Something You Are
#### Common Biometrics
| Modality | Accuracy | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Retina** üëÅÔ∏è | Highest | Privacy concerns; 3 in. range |
| **Iris** üëÄ | Very high | 20‚Äì40 ft; can be spoofed with image |
| **Fingerprint** üñêÔ∏è | High | Consumer devices; minutiae matching |
| **Palm Vein** ‚úã | High | Near-infrared vein scan |
| **Face** üôÇ | Moderate | Used in mobile unlock, border control |
| **Voiceprint** üé§ | Lower | Affected by illness, environment |

#### Error Metrics
| Metric | What It Measures | Alias |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| **FRR** | Valid user rejected | Type I error |
| **FAR** | Impostor accepted | Type II error |
| **CER** | Point where FRR = FAR | Lower CER = better |

Additional considerations:
* **Enrollment time** ‚â§ 2 min preferred.  
* **Throughput rate** ‚â§ 6 s for user acceptance.  
* Sensitivity tuning: raising sensitivity ‚ÜìFAR but ‚ÜëFRR‚Äîchoose based on risk appetite (e.g., secure vault favors low FAR).

### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

**Definition**  
MFA requires two **or more different authentication factors** (e.g., *something you know* + *something you have*). Two-factor authentication (2FA) is the simplest form of MFA. Using two methods from the *same* factor (e.g., password + PIN) **is NOT MFA**.

| Factor Category | Typical Mechanisms | Common Threats | Exam Note |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|-----------|
| Something You Know | Password, PIN, passphrase | Brute-force, phishing | Weakest factor |
| Something You Have | Smartcard, OTP token, hardware passkey | Theft, cloning | SMS OTP is **deprecated** by NIST 800-63B üìµ |
| Something You Are | Fingerprint, iris, facial scan | Spoofing, sensor bypass | Strongest factor |
| Somewhere You Are / Do | Geolocation, gestures | GPS spoofing | Context-aware, adaptive |

**Security Benefit** üõ°Ô∏è  
An attacker must compromise *all* factors‚Äîraising the difficulty exponentially.

> **CISSP Tip:** MFA strength comes from *factor diversity*, not sheer number of steps.

### Passwordless Authentication

**Concept**  
Eliminates memorized secrets. Users authenticate with hardware tokens, biometrics, or cryptographic ‚Äúpasskeys‚Äù compliant with **FIDO2/WebAuthn** standards.

| Approach | How It Works | Pros | Cons/Challenges |
|----------|--------------|------|-----------------|
| Biometric unlock (face, fingerprint) | Device stores private key in Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and signs a challenge | User convenience üòä | Sensor spoofing, device loss |
| Hardware passkey (e.g., YubiKey) | Asymmetric key pair; user taps device to sign | Phishing-resistant | Cost, user training |
| Platform passkey (synced via cloud) | Private key split & escrowed among secure enclaves on user devices | Seamless cross-device | Vendor lock-in, recovery complexity |

**Why It Matters for the Exam**  
Password fatigue ‚Üí risky behavior ‚Üí breaches. Passwordless mitigates these user-centric weaknesses while supporting MFA (e.g., device + biometric).

### Device Authentication

Identifies and validates **endpoint devices** before network or application access.

| Technique | Description | Typical Use |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Device fingerprinting | Browser/OS attributes (fonts, plug-ins, timezone, etc.) hashed into a unique ID | Web apps, risk-based auth |
| 802.1X | Port-based NAC enforcing EAP methods | Wired/wireless LAN |
| MDM + NAC | Mobile posture checks (OS version, jailbreak) | BYOD environments |
| Certificates | X.509 issued to device; TLS mutual auth | VPN, IoT |

> **Exam Angle:** Device auth complements user auth‚Äîboth are needed to stop rogue endpoints.

### Service Authentication

Services (daemons, scheduled jobs, APIs) use *service accounts* or certificates to prove identity.

* **Service Account Hardening**
  * Long, complex password üîë
  * ‚ÄúPassword never expires‚Äù avoided‚Äîuse managed rotation tools
  * Non-interactive logon flag set
* **Certificate-Based Service Auth**
  * Mutual TLS between microservices
  * API keys with short TTLs + scopes

**Audit Concern**  
Service accounts often have elevated privileges. Regular **account access reviews** catch stale or over-privileged services.

### Mutual Authentication

Both entities **authenticate each other** to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

| Scenario | Mechanism | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Client‚ÄìServer | TLS with client certificates | Remote VPN connection |
| Peer-to-Peer | Kerberos AP-REQ / AP-REP messages | Internal Windows domain comms |
| API-to-API | OAuth 2.0 mTLS or signed JWTs | Microservice mesh |

Failure to authenticate either side terminates the session‚Äîprotecting credentials from rogue endpoints.

### Implementing Identity Management

Centralized vs. decentralized architectures govern how identities and authorizations are stored and verified.

#### Single Sign-On

*Authenticate once, access many resources.*

| Benefit | Risk | Mitigation |
|---------|------|------------|
| Fewer passwords ‚Üí less reuse/writing | Single credential = single point of failure | MFA, session time-outs |
| Streamlined provisioning | Wide breach blast radius | Strong logging & anomaly detection |

Common protocols: **Kerberos, LDAP bind, SAML, OAuth/OIDC, Kerberos-based AD SSO**.

#### SSO and Federated Identities

Single Sign-On (SSO) lets a user **authenticate once** and then reuse that assertion across multiple applications or systems üóùÔ∏è.  
Federated Identity Management (FIM) extends this concept **across organizational boundaries**, mapping an internal identity to a shared **federated ID** that partner systems trust.

##### Why It Matters
| Benefit | Exam Lens | Caveat |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Fewer credentials ‚Üí less password fatigue | Usability vs. security trade-off | If SSO token is stolen, attacker gains broad access |
| Transparent access to partner resources | *Security Architecture & Engineering* + *IAM* domains | Each resource owner still defines its own authorization policies |
| Centralized auditing | Supports non-repudiation | Requires robust logging infrastructure |

##### Components & Protocols
| Layer | Purpose | Common Protocols / Standards |
|-------|---------|------------------------------|
| **Assertion** | Carry identity & attributes | SAML 2.0 (XML), OIDC (JSON/JWT) |
| **Authorization** | Delegate access via tokens | OAuth 2.0 (Bearer, mTLS, JWT) |
| **Trust Framework** | Define legal & technical rules | Federation agreements, metadata exchange |

##### Federation Deployment Models
| Model | Where IdP Lives | Typical Use Case | Control Level | Latency |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| **Cloud-Based Federation** ‚òÅÔ∏è | Third-party IdP | SaaS training portal, HR benefits | Low (outsourced) | Depends on provider |
| **On-Premises Federation** üè¢ | Inside each org‚Äôs DC | M&A between two companies | High (full admin) | LAN-speed |
| **Hybrid Federation** üîÑ | Mix of on-prem & cloud | Gradual cloud migration | Medium | Variable |

> **Exam Tip:** Federation ‚â† automatic access to everything. Each service owner still enforces **least privilege**.

##### Cloud-Based Federation
* External IdP (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) holds federated IDs.  
* Internal login ID ‚Üí mapped to federated ID ‚Üí SAML/OIDC assertion to SaaS.  
* Fast to deploy; dependency on provider uptime and SLAs.

##### On-Premises Federation
* Internal IdP servers exchange trust metadata (certs, endpoints).  
* Ideal for organizations needing strict data residency or custom workflows.  
* Acts as an SSO ‚Äúbridge‚Äù after mergers.

##### Hybrid Federation
* Combine on-prem IdP with cloud IdP to cover all apps.  
* Enables phased migration or multi-cloud strategy.  
* Careful token/cookie domain scoping required.

##### Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning
| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | User authenticated in home IdP |
| 2 | First visit to service provider (SP) triggers SAML/OIDC assertion |
| 3 | SP auto-creates local account with received attributes | 
| 4 | User gains immediate access without help-desk ticket üí° |

*Reduces administrative overhead* but relies on accurate attribute mapping (e.g., `email`, `role`).

##### Exam Checkpoints
* Know how **SAML, OAuth, and OIDC** differ (assertion vs. delegation vs. authentication layer).  
* Understand that **federated ID** is a *reference token*‚Äînot necessarily the same as local username.  
* JIT ‚â† full provisioning lifecycle; off-boarding still required to avoid orphaned access.  
* SSO tokens must be protected (TLS, short TTL, secure cookies) to maintain **Confidentiality** and **Integrity** of the assertion.

#### Credential Management Systems

Enterprise or browser-integrated vaults that store credentials encrypted at rest.

| Feature | Security Point |
|---------|----------------|
| Auto-fill / auto-login | Beware of click-jacking |
| Master secret / hardware-backed key | Single point requiring strong protection |
| API (W3C Credential Management) | Enables federated IdP pickup |

IDaaS = **Identity as a Service**‚Äîcloud-hosted IAM delivering SSO/MFA.

#### Credential Manager Apps

User-side password vaults (e.g., Windows Credential Manager, KeePass, 1Password).

* Store secrets in encrypted DB (AES‚Äê256).  
* Recommend unique passphrase master key + MFA unlock.

#### Scripted Access

Logon scripts or automation tools inject credentials for legacy systems lacking SSO.

*Advantages:* Simulates SSO where none exists.  
*Risks:* Credentials often stored in **cleartext**‚Äîrestrict file ACLs & use secure vault references.

#### Session Management

Controls for *post-authentication* lifecycle.

| Control | Desktop Example | Web Example |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| Idle lockout | Screen saver lock after 15 min | HTTP session cookie timeout |
| Absolute timeout | Forced logoff after 8 hr shift | JWT exp/nbf claims |
| Re-auth for sensitive ops | UAC prompt in Windows | Re-enter password for bank transfer |

Secure frameworks enforce **TLS**, use random session IDs, and rotate IDs after privilege elevation.

## Managing the Identity and Access Provisioning Life Cycle

The provisioning life cycle üîÑ governs **creation, use, review, and retirement** of every identity (user, device, service) that can access organizational assets. Proper lifecycle controls underpin CIA, least privilege, and non-repudiation on the CISSP exam.

### Provisioning and Onboarding

| Step | Key Activities | Exam Pointers |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| **Identity Proofing** | Validate hire via photo ID, background/credit checks, clearance verification | NIST 800-63A assurance levels |
| **Account Enrollment** | Create unique username; capture required attributes (name, email, biometrics) | Automation ensures naming consistency |
| **Privilege Assignment** | Map user to roles/groups ‚Üí inherited permissions | *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* best practice |
| **Asset Issuance** | Laptops, smartcards, OTP tokens recorded in inventory | Chain-of-custody logs |
| **Onboarding Brief** | AUP signature ‚úçÔ∏è, security awareness, help-desk procedures | CISSP stresses people + process |

> **Tip:** Automated provisioning tools reduce human error and support *just-enough* access from day one.

### Deprovisioning and Offboarding

| Task | Rationale | Pitfalls |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Disable (then delete) account** | Prevents logon while preserving data for review | Immediate deletion may orphan encrypted files |
| **Recover/transfer data** | Manager reviews mailboxes, files, encryption keys üîë | Plan for personal vs corporate data segregation |
| **Revoke credentials & access tokens** | Blocks SSO, VPN, cloud apps | API keys, certificates often forgotten |
| **Asset return** | Laptop, mobile, passkeys‚Äîverify against inventory | Loss inflates risk & costs |
| **Terminate benefits** | Stop payroll, insurance to cut fraud | Case study: UW $8 M overpayment shows risk |

A speedy, scripted offboarding process mitigates **insider threat** and supports evidence of due care.

### Role Definition and Transition

* Define new roles with **least privilege matrices** (permissions, groups, systems).  
* Use *Separation of Duties (SoD)* to avoid fraud (e.g., dev ‚â† prod deploy).  
* During transfers/promotions, **remove old entitlements first** to curb privilege creep.

> Remember: RBAC changes should follow a formal **change-management workflow** to preserve audit trails.

### Account Maintenance

Ongoing tasks include:

* Password resets / MFA re-registration  
* Updates to **attribute data** (title, department) feeding role engines  
* Service account key rotation (90-day typical for high-privilege)  
* Certificate renewal before expiration

Administration scripts should be **idempotent** (repeatable with same result) and enforce policy baselines.

### Account Access Review

| Control | Focus | Frequency | Outcome |
|---------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Inactive Account Scan** | No logon ‚â• 30 days | Weekly | Auto-disable |
| **Privilege Review** | Administrator / root, service, system accounts | Monthly/quarterly | Remove excess rights |
| **Segregation Audit** | Conflicting roles (e.g., AP & AR) | Quarterly | SoD exception report |
| **Attestation** | Managers re-confirm team access | Annual | Compliance evidence |

*Issues Discovered*

| Term | Definition | Remedy |
|------|------------|--------|
| **Excessive privilege** | Rights > job needs | Revoke privileges |
| **Privilege creep** | Layered rights over time | Re-baseline role |

Automated identity-governance tools generate dashboards and evidence for ISO 27001, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.

## Summary

* The **identity & access provisioning life cycle** ensures that every account is *born secure, lives governed, and dies cleanly*.  
* **Provisioning/onboarding** grants correct initial access and educates the user.  
* **Deprovisioning/offboarding** withdraws all access and assets at exit‚Äîcritical for insider-threat defense.  
* **Role definition/transition** aligns privileges with evolving business duties while enforcing least privilege and SoD.  
* **Account maintenance** keeps credentials, attributes, and systems in sync.  
* **Access reviews** detect and correct excessive privilege and privilege creep, providing audit assurance.  

Mastering this life cycle equips you to answer CISSP questions on RBAC, lifecycle management, and audit compliance with confidence ‚úÖ.
