## [Shared Responsibility]()

* **Cloud / Outsourcing rule** — Provider secures **the cloud**, customer secures **what’s IN the cloud** (workloads, data, IAM).  
* Model shifts by service: IaaS (“you patch OS”), PaaS (just code & data), SaaS (mostly identity & configs).  
* Contractual artifacts: **CSA CAIQ, CSPM findings, FedRAMP RAR**.

---

## [Data Localization and Data Sovereignty]()

* **Data residency laws** (GDPR, POPIA, PDPA) dictate *where* PII can live/flow.  
* Requires region-pinned storage, geo-fencing, **geo-key management (HSM cluster by region)**, and lawful-access assessments.

---

## [Assess and Mitigate the Vulnerabilities of Security Architectures, Designs, and Solution Elements]()

### [Hardware]()
- Side-channel (Spectre/Meltdown, Rowhammer).  
- **Secure/Measured Boot**, PUF, chip burn-in, tamper seals.

### [Firmware]()
- UEFI rootkits; mitigate with **Secure Boot, attestation, signed updates**.  
- BMC/iLO isolation, firmware SBOM.

---

## [Client-Based Systems]()

### [Mobile Code]()
- Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, Flash ➜ sandboxing, code signing.

### [Local Caches]()
- Browser, DNS, SSO tokens — attack: **cache poisoning/side-jacking**; defense: no-store headers, cache busting.

---

## [Server-Based Systems]()

### [Large-Scale Parallel Data Systems]()
- Hadoop / Spark – threats: **data node compromise, unsecured REST APIs**.

### [Grid Computing]()
- BOINC style — authenticate nodes, encrypt jobs/results.

### [Peer to Peer]()
- Risks: **uncontrolled propagation, DDoS amplification, data leakage**.

---

## [Industrial Control Systems]()
* **SCADA / DCS / PLC**; legacy OT protocols (Modbus, DNP3) unauthenticated ⇒ add **data-diodes, ICS-DMZ, ISA/IEC 62443 zoning**.

---

## [Distributed Systems]()
* CAP theorem trade-offs; secure RPC, **service mesh (mTLS)**; clock/timestamp integrity.

---

## [High-Performance Computing (HPC) Systems]()
* Focus on **MPI isolation, job-scheduler authN, InfiniBand segmentation**; risk: IP theft of research data.

---

## [Real-Time Operating Systems]()
* Deterministic latency; security vs timing.  
* Use **memory-safe languages**, W^X, MPU.

---

## [Internet of Things]()
* Constrained devices, default creds, weak update paths.  
* Controls: **device ID attestation, network micro-segmentation, MUD, SBOM**.

---

## [Edge and Fog Computing]()
* Push compute near data; widens threat surface.  
* Secure via **zero-trust, lightweight EDR, 5G slice isolation**.

---

## [Embedded Devices and Cyber-Physical Systems]()

### [Static Systems]()
- “Set-and-forget” (ATMs, kiosks). Patching & physical locks critical.

### [Cyber-Physical Systems]()
- Sensors/actuators—safety + security; **IEC 61508, NIST SP 800-82**.

### [Security Concerns of Embedded and Static Systems]()
- Hard-coded creds, JTAG ports, EEPROM dumps; add **secure enclave, fuse keys, conformal coating**.

---

## [Microservices]()
* REST/gRPC, containers, **service mesh**.  
* Threats: privilege sprawl, API abuse ➜ OPA, mTLS, JWT lifetimes.

---

## [Infrastructure as Code]()
* Terraform, Ansible. Security = **code reviews, secrets mgmt, drift detection, pre-commit scans**.

---

## [Immutable Architecture]()
* Rebuild not patch. Benefits: eliminates config drift, faster rollback.  
* Requires **CI/CD, blue-green**, image signing.

---

## [Virtualized Systems]()

### [Virtual Software]()
- **Hypervisor escapes** (VENOM); patch, use Type-1, disable clipboard.

### [Virtualized Networking]()
- vSwitch/VXLAN; inspect with **vTAP, micro-segmentation**.

### [Software-Defined Everything]()
- Control plane compromise ⇒ whole fabric; protect via **RBAC, API certs**.

### [Virtualization Security Management]()
- vCenter hardening, **VM templates**, snapshot chain integrity.

---

## [Containerization]()
* Image poisoning, breakout (runC). Mitigate with **namespaces, seccomp, AppArmor/SELinux**, signed images (Notary, cosign).

---

## [Mobile Devices]()

### [Mobile Device Security Features]()
- Root of Trust, Secure Element, sandbox, biometric, FDE.

### [Mobile Device Deployment Policies]()
- **COPE, CYOD, BYOD**; enforce with MDM/UEM, containerization, remote wipe.

---

## [Essential Security Protection Mechanisms]()

### [Process Isolation]()
- Process rings, user/kernel separation, ASLR for each process.

### [Hardware Segmentation]()
- IOMMU, SR-IOV, **TPM PCR** measurements.

### [Root of Trust]()
- Hardware anchor verifying firmware/OS chain.

### [System Security Policy]()
- Formal statement of **MAC rules, multilevel labels, P0 vs P4 priorities**.

---

## [Common Security Architecture Flaws and Issues]()

### [Convert Channels]()
- Covert storage/timing; mitigate → noise, auditing, *noninterference* design.

### [Attacks Based on Design or Coding Flaws]()
- Buffer overflow, use-after-free. Defense: **memory-safe languages, fuzzing, SAST/DAST**.

### [Rootkits]()
- Kernel-mode or firmware; detect with **integrity measurement architecture (IMA)**, offline scan.

### [Incremental Attacks]()
- “Salami slicing,” bit-flipping, **TOCTOU** — input validation, atomic ops.

---

## [Summary]()
- Modern architecture → sprawling attack surface (cloud, edge, OT, IoT).  
- **Shared-responsibility & data-sovereignty** shape control choices.  
- Harden layers: hardware, firmware, OS, containers, micro-services.  
- Key mechanisms: **process isolation, secure boot, segmentation, IaC guardrails**.  
- Watch for covert channels, rootkits, design-level bugs; employ defense-in-depth & continuous monitoring to mitigate.
