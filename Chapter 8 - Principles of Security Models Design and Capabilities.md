## Secure Design Principles

### Objects and Subjects

In information security, all access control is based on the **interaction between subjects and objects**.

- A **subject** is an active entity (e.g., user, process, program) that requests access to a resource.
- An **object** is a passive entity (e.g., file, printer, database) that contains or receives data and is acted upon.

This model helps define **who can do what to which resources**, forming the foundation for **access control mechanisms** like DAC, MAC, and RBAC.

#### Subject-Object Relationship
The **access control system** determines how subjects can interact with objects. Examples include:
- User (subject) reading a document (object)
- Process writing to a log file
- Program executing another process

| Term    | Description                                  |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| Subject | Active entity requesting access               |
| Object  | Passive entity being accessed                 |
| Access  | The operation (read/write/execute) performed  |

üß† **CISSP Insight**: Every access control mechanism uses subjects and objects to define permissions, restrictions, and enforcement boundaries.

#### Dynamic Roles
An entity can act as a subject in one context and as an object in another.
- Example:
  - Process A (subject) ‚Üí Process B (object)
  - Process B (now subject) ‚Üí Process C (object)

This flexible interpretation is important in **multi-threaded systems**, **inter-process communication**, and **chained execution flows**.

#### Transitive Trust

**Transitive trust** occurs when a subject inherits or extends trust through an intermediary entity.

- If A trusts B, and B trusts C, then A may **implicitly trust** C.
- This chain can lead to **unintended access** and **security gaps** if not carefully managed.

üö® **Exam Warning**: Transitive trust is especially dangerous in federated systems and cloud-based environments. Always evaluate the **full trust chain**.

#### Access Rules
Access control models implement rules to govern subject-object interactions:
- **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Subject owns the object and defines access.
- **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)**: Access is based on labels (e.g., Top Secret).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access based on user roles.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Know which models use subjects/objects explicitly and how **subject-object pairs** are evaluated for permissions.

#### Summary

- The subject-object model defines **who interacts with what**, and **how**.
- It is fundamental to **access control**, **system design**, and **security model implementation**.
- Understanding this relationship helps identify **risk points** and enforce **least privilege**.

| Concept           | Summary                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Subject           | Active initiator of access (user/process)                              |
| Object            | Passive target of access (file/device)                                 |
| Access Control    | Restricts which subjects can perform which actions on which objects     |
| Transitive Trust  | Indirect trust that can extend across systems; may be unsafe            |
| Dynamic Behavior  | Same entity can act as subject or object depending on context           |

### Closed and Open Systems

Closed and open systems describe **how much visibility and control** an organization or developer has over the internal mechanisms of a system. These classifications influence **interoperability, security review, and trust**.

#### Closed Systems
A **closed system** is proprietary and restricted:
- The **internal workings are not shared** publicly.
- Typically developed by a **single organization or vendor**.
- Requires **vendor support** for updates, patches, and integrations.
- Can create **vendor lock-in** and **limited transparency**.

Advantages:
- Centralized control
- Consistency and product support

Disadvantages:
- Difficult to audit for vulnerabilities
- Limited interoperability with third-party systems

üîí **Example**: Microsoft Windows source code is closed‚Äîonly Microsoft can modify it.

#### Open Systems
An **open system** is designed with **public interfaces, standards, and transparency**:
- Encourages **interoperability** and **community collaboration**.
- Source code or system documentation is often **accessible** or **open**.
- Supports **open standards** for easier integration.

Advantages:
- Easier to audit and test
- Often community-driven improvements
- Less vendor dependency

Disadvantages:
- Greater variation in implementation quality
- May require more effort to maintain or support

üåç **Example**: Linux distributions like Ubuntu are considered open systems.

#### APIs and Interoperability

**APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** enable **interoperability** between open and closed systems by defining how software components interact.

- Well-documented APIs can allow **secure, controlled access** to core functionality.
- Open systems often expose APIs for external developers.
- Closed systems may offer **limited or proprietary APIs** only under strict licensing.

üß© **Interoperability** is key for:
- Enabling multi-vendor environments
- Reducing vendor lock-in
- Supporting hybrid architectures (e.g., cloud + on-prem)

#### Open Source vs Closed Source

| Category       | Open Source                              | Closed Source                               |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Access         | Publicly viewable and modifiable code     | Proprietary code controlled by vendor        |
| Transparency   | High (anyone can inspect code)            | Low (security by obscurity risk)             |
| Community      | Often developed collaboratively           | Developed internally                         |
| Customization  | Highly customizable                       | Limited customization                        |
| Support        | Community and vendor options (varied)     | Official vendor support                      |
| Licensing      | GPL, MIT, Apache, etc.                    | Vendor-specific EULA                         |

üí° **CISSP Insight**: Open source is not inherently secure. It allows inspection, but security depends on **code quality**, **patching discipline**, and **community support**.

#### Summary

Closed and open systems differ in **transparency**, **control**, and **integration**:
- Closed systems offer consistency and control but may restrict visibility.
- Open systems enable interoperability and inspection but require more due diligence.
- APIs bridge both models and facilitate secure system integration.
- Exam questions may test your ability to evaluate **risk**, **trust**, and **integration complexity** based on system type.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Don‚Äôt confuse open source with secure by default. Know when each model is appropriate based on business needs and threat posture.

### Secure Defaults

**Secure defaults** refer to configuring systems and applications in their **most secure state by default**, minimizing the attack surface **before any customization or deployment**.

Many breaches occur because default settings are **insecure**, left unchanged, or overly permissive.

#### Why Secure Defaults Matter

When systems ship with:
- Open ports
- Default credentials
- Unrestricted access
‚Ä¶they become **low-hanging fruit** for attackers.

Secure defaults embody the **principle of least privilege** ‚Äî every user, process, and service should have the **minimum access necessary**.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Insight**: Secure defaults enforce protection *before* users or admins apply hardening. They're proactive defenses.

#### Key Principles of Secure Defaults

- **Disable unnecessary services**: Fewer services = fewer attack vectors.
- **Use restrictive access controls**: Deny by default, explicitly allow only trusted actions.
- **Disable guest accounts and default passwords**: Often exploited in attacks.
- **Enable logging and auditing by default**: Ensure traceability.
- **Secure installation paths**: Avoid executing from temporary or user-writable directories.
- **Minimal feature sets**: Only enable essential functionality.

#### Restrictive Defaults

A **restrictive default posture** means that **all access is denied unless explicitly granted**.

- Example: A firewall drops all traffic unless a rule permits it.
- Encourages **intentional, controlled configuration**.
- Follows the **"deny-by-default"** model.

| Configuration Style | Description                                        | Security Posture     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Open by Default     | Services and access are broadly enabled            | ‚ùå High risk          |
| Restrictive Default | Nothing is accessible until explicitly permitted   | ‚úÖ Secure and auditable |

üö® **Exam Reminder**: Systems should not rely on users to manually secure configurations. The **default** should already be hardened.

#### Common Violations of Secure Defaults

- Leaving **SSH or RDP open** to the internet
- Using **admin/admin** or **root/toor** as default credentials
- Web servers with **directory listing enabled**
- Databases with **blank or default passwords**

‚úÖ **Fix**: Apply configuration management and compliance scanning to enforce secure settings.

#### Summary

Secure defaults reduce risk by:
- Disabling risky features
- Enforcing least privilege
- Denying access by default
- Promoting intentional and secure configurations

| Concept               | Summary                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure Defaults        | Preconfigured to the most secure state possible                        |
| Restrictive Defaults   | Deny all by default, explicitly allow only necessary access             |
| Common Violations      | Unused services enabled, default passwords, open ports                  |
| Risk Reduction         | Secure defaults reduce reliance on users to harden systems post-deploy |

üîë **CISSP Exam Tip**: Remember ‚Äî **security should be opt-out, not opt-in**. Always favor **secure defaults** in system design.

### Fail Securely

**Fail securely** means that when a system, component, or control encounters an error or failure, it **defaults to a secure state**‚Äînot an open or permissive one.

This principle ensures that **security is preserved even during abnormal conditions** such as power failures, application crashes, or denied access attempts.

#### Key Concepts of Failing Securely

- If **authorization cannot be verified**, access should be denied.
- If a system **crashes or loses power**, sensitive data should not be exposed.
- If an error occurs during input validation, the input should be **rejected**, not accepted.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Insight**: Systems should never fail in a way that bypasses security controls or exposes sensitive data.

#### Fail-Open vs Fail-Closed

| Fail Behavior | Description                                         | Security Implication |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Fail-Open**  | Allows access or functionality when failure occurs  | ‚ùå High risk          |
| **Fail-Closed**| Denies access and halts operation on failure        | ‚úÖ Secure option      |

**Fail-closed** is the preferred secure behavior.

**Example**:
- A firewall should **fail-closed**, blocking traffic if rules cannot be loaded.
- An access control mechanism should deny entry if authentication fails, not allow a bypass.

#### Fail-Safe vs Fail-Secure

These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but have subtle differences:

| Term        | Context                | Behavior on Failure                             |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fail-Safe   | **Safety-first**       | Prioritizes human safety over security (e.g., unlock doors during a fire) |
| Fail-Secure | **Security-first**     | Maintains security posture even if inconvenient (e.g., locked doors during a fire) |

‚ö†Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Note**: Know the difference. Fail-safe = physical safety; fail-secure = data/security protection.

#### Stop Error and BSoD

- A **stop error** (e.g., Windows **Blue Screen of Death (BSoD)**) halts the system when a critical fault occurs.
- While disruptive, it may be **intentional to prevent further damage** or corruption.

üß† **Security Perspective**:
- Crashes are not inherently secure unless they **preserve confidentiality and integrity** during the failure.
- Systems must log the failure, retain audit trails, and **not expose data in memory**.

#### Summary

Failing securely ensures that when things go wrong, they do so **safely and securely**, preventing data leaks or unauthorized access.

| Concept              | Summary                                                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fail-Closed          | Deny access or halt system upon failure (secure default)               |
| Fail-Open            | Allow access upon failure (dangerous, avoid unless safety-critical)     |
| Fail-Safe            | Prioritize physical safety (e.g., exit doors unlock during emergencies) |
| Fail-Secure          | Prioritize system/data security (e.g., remain locked on power loss)     |
| BSoD/Stop Error      | Forceful system halt to prevent further errors‚Äîmay help preserve integrity |

‚úÖ **CISSP Exam Tip**: When designing controls, ask: ‚ÄúIf this fails, does it fail in a way that protects or exposes the system?‚Äù

### Keep It Simple and Small (KISS)

The **Keep It Simple and Small (KISS)** principle emphasizes simplicity in design to enhance security, reliability, and maintainability. In the context of security architecture, **complex systems are harder to secure, audit, and understand**, increasing the risk of misconfiguration and undetected vulnerabilities.

üß† **CISSP Insight**: Complexity is the enemy of security. Simpler designs are more likely to be **secure by default** and easier to evaluate or test.

#### Principle Overview

- Originates from military and engineering practices: ‚ÄúSimple systems fail less.‚Äù
- Encourages minimal features and straightforward logic.
- Smaller codebases and systems have **fewer attack surfaces**.
- Reduces the likelihood of errors, misconfigurations, and hidden backdoors.

#### Benefits of KISS in Security

| Benefit               | Description                                                                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fewer Attack Vectors  | Less complexity = fewer potential exploits                                          |
| Easier Auditing       | Simpler systems are easier to understand, test, and validate                        |
| Faster Patching       | Less code means bugs can be found and fixed more quickly                            |
| Better Maintainability| Less chance of introducing errors when making changes                               |
| Improved Availability | Fewer components mean less can go wrong                                             |

#### Related Design Principles

##### DRY (Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself)
- Avoid duplication in code and logic.
- Changes only need to happen in one place‚Äîreduces errors and inconsistencies.

##### YAGNI (You Aren‚Äôt Gonna Need It)
- Only implement features that are absolutely necessary.
- Unused features can create **dead code**, increasing the attack surface.

##### Minimalism in Security
- The fewer modules, services, and ports exposed, the better.
- Use **minimal default installations**, turning off unnecessary functions.

üõ°Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: You may encounter scenarios where a system with fewer functions is preferred because it adheres to KISS and minimizes risk.

#### Example in Practice

- Instead of a full-featured mail server with dozens of unnecessary services, deploy a lightweight MTA (Mail Transfer Agent) that only relays outbound email.
- Disable unused Windows features and services rather than leaving them running "just in case."

#### Summary

The **KISS principle** supports security through **simplification**. By reducing complexity, organizations can:
- Limit vulnerabilities
- Simplify audits
- Ensure systems behave predictably

| Concept       | Summary                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KISS          | Design systems to be simple and minimal                          |
| DRY           | Avoid redundancy to simplify updates and reduce risk             |
| YAGNI         | Don‚Äôt build features you don‚Äôt currently need                    |
| Minimalism    | Fewer services and features = smaller attack surface             |

üîç **CISSP Reminder**: KISS applies not only to application code but also to **system architecture, policies, and security configurations**.

### Zero Trust

**Zero Trust** is a modern security architecture and mindset based on the principle:  
> **‚ÄúNever trust, always verify.‚Äù**

It assumes that **no user, device, or system‚Äîinternal or external‚Äîshould be automatically trusted**. Every access request must be continuously validated based on identity, context, and risk.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Insight**: Zero Trust is not a single product‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategy involving **identity verification, access controls, segmentation, and monitoring**.

#### Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify explicitly**  
   - Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data (user identity, device health, location, etc.).

2. **Use least privilege access**  
   - Limit user and device access to only what is needed for their role (principle of least privilege).

3. **Assume breach**  
   - Design systems under the assumption that attackers are already inside the network.

#### Key Components of Zero Trust

| Component                | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity & Access Management (IAM) | Strong authentication (MFA), continuous session validation         |
| Network Segmentation     | Divides networks into small segments to contain threats                    |
| Endpoint Security        | Ensures device compliance (e.g., up-to-date patches, EDR agents)           |
| Monitoring & Analytics   | Detect anomalies and potential breaches in real-time                       |

#### Microsegmentation

Microsegmentation breaks the network into **fine-grained zones**, applying access controls at the **workload or process level** rather than the perimeter.

- Limits lateral movement
- Isolates breaches
- Enforced with tools like **NGFW**, **SDN**, and **host-based firewalls**

üß± Example:
A compromised printer on the guest VLAN cannot access sensitive finance servers.

#### Real-time Monitoring

Zero Trust emphasizes **continuous monitoring** for authentication, network behavior, and data access.

- Leverages tools like **UEBA (User and Entity Behavior Analytics)** and **SIEM**
- Detects and responds to threats **before damage occurs**
- Integrates with incident response workflows

üìå **CISSP Note**: Zero Trust doesn‚Äôt mean trusting nothing‚Äîit means **verifying everything**, all the time.

#### Air Gap and Faraday Cage

To support Zero Trust at the **physical level**, organizations may implement:

- **Air Gap**: Complete disconnection from other networks (often used in ICS/SCADA).
- **Faraday Cage**: Enclosure that blocks electromagnetic signals to prevent wireless data leaks or eavesdropping.

üîí These methods enforce physical isolation and prevent **covert channels**.

#### Summary

Zero Trust is a **strategic model** that enforces **strong authentication, granular authorization, and continuous monitoring** to reduce risk across complex environments.

| Concept                | Summary                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero Trust             | Never trust, always verify‚Äîeven inside the perimeter                    |
| Microsegmentation      | Small, isolated zones prevent lateral movement                          |
| Real-time Monitoring   | Detect threats based on behavior, identity, and session context         |
| Air Gap / Faraday Cage | Enforce physical and electromagnetic isolation                          |
| Principle of Least Privilege | Critical to Zero Trust‚Äîaccess only what is absolutely necessary    |

üîê **CISSP Tip**: Expect exam questions that test Zero Trust as a **comprehensive architecture**, not just a technical control.

### Trust but Verify

**Trust but Verify** is a classic security concept that emphasizes the need for continuous validation‚Äîeven when access or actions are initially trusted.

Originating from a Russian proverb popularized during Cold War-era arms control negotiations, the phrase has since been widely adopted in cybersecurity. It reflects a **cautious mindset**: even trusted users, systems, or processes should undergo **ongoing checks** to ensure they behave as expected.

üß† **CISSP Insight**: This principle acts as a **bridge between traditional perimeter-based security and Zero Trust**, emphasizing the importance of **monitoring**, **auditing**, and **continuous assurance**.

#### Core Concept

- **Trust**: Granting access based on identity, role, or past behavior.
- **Verify**: Constantly monitor and reassess that trust is still valid.

This principle is vital for detecting **insider threats**, **credential compromise**, and **policy drift** in long-running systems.

#### Examples in Security Design

| Scenario                               | Trust                     | Verification Mechanism                      |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Employee with VPN access               | Role-based access granted | Session logs, MFA challenges                |
| Cloud admin account                    | Admin privileges assigned | Activity monitoring, audit trails           |
| Signed application                     | Trusted publisher         | Runtime behavior monitoring, hash checking  |
| Internal system-to-system communication| Whitelisted IP or token   | Mutual TLS, anomaly detection               |

#### Mechanisms to Implement ‚ÄúTrust but Verify‚Äù

- **Audit Logs**: Track who accessed what, when, and how.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitor for behavior deviating from baselines.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Even trusted users re-authenticate.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Access**: Grant time-limited privileges.
- **Behavioral Analytics (UEBA)**: Detect suspicious user actions.

üö® **CISSP Exam Tip**: Trust but verify is key to **defense-in-depth**. It complements Zero Trust, not replaces it.

#### Comparison: Trust but Verify vs. Zero Trust

| Principle           | Focus                                       | Default Stance             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Trust but Verify    | Validate trust continuously                 | Trust initially, then verify|
| Zero Trust          | Deny by default, trust no one automatically | Verify before trusting      |

üìå While ‚ÄúTrust but Verify‚Äù assumes **initial trust** with ongoing validation, **Zero Trust** removes initial assumptions altogether.

#### Summary

The **Trust but Verify** principle helps maintain **security assurance** by requiring:

- Continuous monitoring
- Verification of behavior and access
- Reevaluation of roles and permissions

| Key Aspect              | Summary                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Principle                | Trust must be earned and revalidated, not assumed permanently |
| Use Case                 | Ongoing verification for privileged users or critical systems  |

### Privacy by Design (PbD)

**Privacy by Design (PbD)** is a proactive security framework that integrates **privacy protections into the design and architecture** of systems and business processes from the outset‚Äînot after deployment.

Originally developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian, former Information & Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, PbD is now recognized globally, including by the **EU GDPR** and many **international privacy frameworks**.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Know that PbD ensures **privacy is a core design element**‚Äînot an afterthought. It's a shift from reactive compliance to proactive design.

#### Key Concept

- Build systems that inherently **respect and protect privacy**.
- Avoid ‚Äúbolting on‚Äù privacy controls after deployment.
- Focus on **data minimization**, **user consent**, and **transparency**.

#### 7 Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design

|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial | Anticipate and prevent privacy invasions before they happen.               |
| Privacy as the Default Setting           | Personal data is automatically protected without user action.              |
| Privacy Embedded into Design             | Privacy is a core part of systems, not a feature added later.              |
| Full Functionality ‚Äî Positive-Sum        | Avoid trade-offs; support both privacy and business goals (not zero-sum).  |
| End-to-End Security ‚Äî Lifecycle Protection| Secure data from collection through deletion.                              |
| Visibility and Transparency              | Operations are visible to users and stakeholders for accountability.       |
| Respect for User Privacy                 | Offer strong privacy defaults, notice, and user-centric options.           |

üß† **Exam Insight**: PbD is **not only about technical measures**‚Äîit includes **policy, governance, and culture**.

#### Global Privacy Standard (GPS)

The **Global Privacy Standard (GPS)** is an international agreement promoting **consistency in privacy expectations and protections**.

- Built on PbD principles.
- Used to **harmonize privacy practices** across different jurisdictions.
- Supports cross-border data transfers under consistent privacy safeguards.

üìå Think of GPS as a **privacy alignment framework**‚Äîespecially critical in global enterprises operating across countries with varying laws.

#### PbD in System Architecture

PbD is applied by:

- Designing systems to **collect only necessary data** (data minimization).
- Using **pseudonymization** or **encryption** to protect stored/transmitted data.
- Providing clear **user consent flows** and **privacy notices**.
- Embedding **logging**, **auditing**, and **privacy-impact assessments (PIAs)**.

#### Examples of PbD Implementation

## Techniques for Ensuring CIA

Maintaining **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** is a foundational goal in information security. To ensure CIA, security architects apply **system design techniques** that control how software and processes behave and interact with resources. These principles are implemented through controls like **confinement**, **bounds**, and **isolation**, and reinforced using **access control** models and **trust/assurance** frameworks.

### Confinement

**Confinement** (also known as **sandboxing**) is the practice of **restricting a process's ability to access memory and system resources**.

- The process is only allowed to interact with **authorized memory locations** or resources.
- Any attempt to exceed these boundaries is denied, logged, and potentially terminated.

üõ°Ô∏è Confinement is an **application of the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**‚Äîeach process can access only what it absolutely needs.

üìå **Implementation Examples**:
- OS-level process isolation
- Security services like **Sandboxie**
- Virtualization solutions (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox)

üß† **CISSP Tip**: Know that confinement is enforced at the OS level and is used to prevent **data leakage** and **unauthorized access**.

### Bounds

**Bounds** define the **limits of authority** for a process or subject in a system.

- A **bound** represents the **maximum scope of access** a subject can have‚Äîwhat it can read, write, or execute.
- Operating systems use bounds to allocate logical or physical memory segments to processes.

| Term       | Description                                                       |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Logical Bounds | Limits enforced through OS mechanisms in shared memory spaces     |
| Physical Bounds| Memory segments physically separated (e.g., hardware isolation)   |

üìå **CISSP Insight**: Bounds are set based on the **process‚Äôs authority level** (e.g., user mode vs kernel mode) and enforced by the OS.

### Isolation

**Isolation** ensures that a process executes in an environment where **its operations do not affect other processes**.

- Achieved through enforcing **confinement and bounds**.
- Prevents both **accidental interference** and **intentional exploitation**.

Benefits of Isolation:
- Allows one process to fail without compromising the entire system.
- Protects the **operating environment**, **kernel**, and other applications.

üìå Isolation is the **foundation of process security** and supports features like **fail-soft systems** and **fault containment**.

| Mechanism      | Purpose                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Hardware isolation | Prevent physical memory overlap     |
| OS-level isolation | Prevent cross-process interference  |
| Virtualization  | Sandboxes entire OS environments       |

### Access Controls

**Access control** ensures that **only authorized subjects can access specific objects**, and only in approved ways.

Access is governed by **rules or policies**, and evaluated by the **access control system**.

Common Models:
- **DAC (Discretionary Access Control)**: Owner sets permissions.
- **MAC (Mandatory Access Control)**: Based on sensitivity labels (e.g., Top Secret).
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Based on assigned roles.
- **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)**: Based on attributes of user, resource, and environment.

üß† **CISSP Exam Tip**: Access controls enforce the CIA triad by **limiting what can be done, by whom, and under what circumstances**.

### Trust and Assurance

**Trust**: The belief that a system will enforce its security policy reliably.

**Assurance**: The **confidence that security measures are implemented correctly** and will function as intended.

Key Points:
- Trust is built by implementing **security mechanisms**.
- Assurance is measured via **testing, validation, and certifications** (e.g., Common Criteria, EAL levels).

üõ†Ô∏è **Assurance Maintenance**:
- **Revalidating** after system changes (e.g., updates, breaches)
- Following best practices in **patch management**, **configuration management**, and **change control**

| Term      | Description                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Trust     | Presence of security functionality                                   |
| Assurance | Confidence in the effectiveness and reliability of that functionality|

üìå **CISSP Insight**: Assurance must be continually maintained and reviewed‚Äîespecially after system changes.

### Summary
| Technique     | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Confinement   | Limits a process to its designated memory/resource space      |
| Bounds        | Defines maximum allowable access for subjects or processes    |
| Isolation     | Prevents one process from interfering with another            |
| Access Control| Enforces who can access what, when, and how                   |
| Trust & Assurance | Evaluates the reliability and strength of security features |

These techniques **collectively reinforce CIA** and are critical to designing secure, stable, and enforceable systems.

## Understand the Fundamental Concepts of Security Models
### Tokens, Capabilities, and Labels
In secure systems, access control decisions are made based on metadata that describes the security attributes of both subjects and objects. There are three primary mechanisms used to represent and enforce these attributes:

#### Tokens
A **security token** is a separate entity (e.g., file, data structure, or object) that holds the **access control attributes** for a particular resource.

- Associated with a subject or object to indicate privileges.
- Used before the actual resource is accessed.
- Can be reused and passed across different components or sessions.

üìå Example: A temporary credential issued during session login that includes user ID, roles, and permissions.

üß† **CISSP Insight**: Tokens can simplify access management, but they must be protected from tampering and replay attacks.

#### Capabilities
A **capability list** is a **subject-centric** structure that defines **what operations the subject can perform** on various objects.

- Each subject maintains its own list of permissions to multiple objects.
- Quicker access decisions for subjects, since no object lookup is needed.
- Less flexible than tokens, as the capability list is tied to the subject.

| Concept       | Focus        | Storage Location        |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Token         | Object-based | Associated with object   |
| Capability    | Subject-based| Associated with subject  |

üß† **CISSP Tip**: In capability systems, revoking access to an object often requires updating **every subject‚Äôs list**‚Äîwhich can be management intensive.

#### Labels
A **security label** is a **permanent, embedded tag** within an object indicating its classification or sensitivity.

- Used in **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** models.
- Labels include classifications like "Confidential," "Secret," etc.
- Once set, labels are **not alterable** by normal users.

üìå Example: A file labeled ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù in a MAC-based system prevents access by users without proper clearance.

üõ°Ô∏è Security labels help enforce **multilevel security** and prevent **unauthorized disclosure**.

#### Summary
| Mechanism   | Description                                              | Usage Scenario                         |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Token       | Security metadata object linked to resource              | Session tokens, Kerberos tickets       |
| Capability  | List of object permissions held by the subject           | Distributed systems, microkernels      |
| Label       | Embedded classification level on the object              | Government MAC systems, SELinux        |

Understanding these mechanisms is essential for identifying how security policies are applied, **who can access what**, and **how permissions are enforced** across different security models.

### Trusted Computing Base (TCB)
The **Trusted Computing Base (TCB)** is the foundation of a secure system. It includes all the **hardware, software, and controls** that enforce the system‚Äôs security policy.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Small and Verifiable**: The TCB should be as **minimal** as possible so it can be **analyzed, verified**, and trusted.
- **Mandatory Component**: Only the TCB can **enforce access controls**, verify credentials, and manage protected system resources.
- **Isolated**: TCB operates within a **protected boundary** (see: Security Perimeter) to prevent tampering from outside components.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Tip**: A secure system is **only as trustworthy** as its TCB. A weak or compromised TCB undermines the entire security model.

#### Responsibilities of the TCB
- Enforces **authentication** and **authorization**
- Protects **memory**, **files**, and **I/O**
- Mediates **all access requests**
- Provides **secure boot**, **process isolation**, and **trusted path** creation

| TCB Role             | Description                                                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enforce Policy        | Ensures all access and operations adhere to the security policy        |
| Validate Access       | Verifies subject credentials before granting object access             |
| Handle Resources      | Manages protected system memory, files, and devices                    |

#### Security Perimeter
- The **security perimeter** is the **imaginary boundary** around the TCB.
- Prevents insecure communication with outside (non-TCB) components.
- Requires **trusted paths** to interact securely with the TCB.

üìå **Trusted Path**: A secure channel for communication between users and the TCB. For example, the Ctrl+Alt+Del screen in Windows is a trusted path for secure login.

#### Reference Monitor Concept
The **Reference Monitor** is an abstract concept that defines how **every access request** is checked before being allowed.

- Must be:
  - **Tamperproof**
  - **Always Invoked**
  - **Small Enough to be Verified**

‚úÖ Implemented in the **Security Kernel**, the software/hardware part of the TCB that enforces reference monitor decisions.

#### Summary
| Concept               | Description                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TCB                    | The system‚Äôs trusted core; enforces security policy                        |
| Security Perimeter     | Isolates the TCB from the rest of the system                               |
| Trusted Path           | A secure method to communicate with the TCB                                |
| Reference Monitor      | The component that checks all subject-object access                        |
| Security Kernel        | The actual implementation of the reference monitor                         |

üß† **CISSP Exam Insight**: You must understand how the TCB, security perimeter, reference monitor, and security kernel relate to each other and the enforcement of access controls.

### State Machine Model
The **State Machine Model** is a foundational security model in which a system is considered secure **if it starts in a secure state and transitions only through secure states**. It underlies many other security models (e.g., Bell‚ÄìLaPadula, Biba).

#### Key Concepts
- A **state** is a snapshot of a system at a specific time.
- A **secure state** is one where **all security rules and policies** are enforced.
- A **state transition** occurs when an input causes the system to change its state.
- A system remains secure **only if every transition leads to another secure state**.

üìå **Formula**:  
`Next State = F(Current State, Input)`  
`Output = F(Current State, Input)`

üß† **CISSP Tip**: If any transition allows violation of security policy, the model breaks down and becomes insecure.

#### Characteristics of Secure State Machine
- **All access requests are verified** before being processed.
- Ensures **consistent security enforcement** even during transitions (e.g., program execution, login/logout, data processing).
- **Boots into a secure state** and maintains security during runtime.

| Concept              | Description                                                             |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure State          | A state where all access controls and policies are enforced             |
| Transition            | A system shift triggered by user input or system event                 |
| Finite State Machine  | The underlying structure used to model the system‚Äôs behavior           |

#### Relevance to Other Models
- The **Bell‚ÄìLaPadula Model** is built on state machine principles to ensure **confidentiality**.
- The **Biba Model** builds upon it to enforce **integrity**.
- Any model that relies on the system evolving over time (like **noninterference** or **information flow**) uses the state machine concept as a base.

üõ°Ô∏è **Security Assurance**: By evaluating all potential states and transitions, you can guarantee the system never enters an insecure configuration.

#### Summary
| Element                | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| State                  | Snapshot of system‚Äôs condition at one moment                           |
| Secure State           | Enforces all security policies                                          |
| Transition             | Input/event that changes the state                                     |
| Secure State Machine   | Guarantees secure operations across all states                         |

üîç **Exam Tip**: Know that state machine models are **mathematical representations** of system behavior and are the **foundation for most formal security models**.

### Information Flow Model
The **Information Flow Model** is a security model that focuses on controlling how information moves within a system to prevent **unauthorized, insecure, or unintended flows**. It is built upon the principles of the **State Machine Model**, extending its use to **multi-level security systems**.

#### Key Objectives
- Ensure that information **only flows in authorized directions**
- Prevent data leakage between **different security levels**
- Block **covert channels** and undefined communication paths

üìå **Example**: In a classified system, a user cleared for "Confidential" should not receive data labeled "Top Secret" ‚Äî even indirectly.

#### Core Characteristics
- Evaluates **all potential paths** of data movement
- Controls not just **who can access what**, but also **how data moves**
- Especially useful in **multi-level security (MLS)** systems, where both subjects and objects have classification levels

#### Types of Information Flow
| Flow Type       | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Explicit Flow     | Directly defined data movements (e.g., copy/paste)                         |
| Implicit Flow     | Indirect effects caused by conditional logic or program state             |
| Covert Channel    | Hidden paths for data to flow in unintended ways                          |

#### Time-Based View
Information Flow Models can also **track data over time**, comparing object states at different moments:
- Ensures that a lower classification object has **not been polluted** by a higher one
- Validates **historical integrity and confidentiality**

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Understand how this model **controls and prevents data leakage**, and how it differs from access control-based models.

#### Multilevel Security (MLS)
Information flow control is essential in systems with **tiered classification levels**, such as:
- Top Secret
- Secret
- Confidential
- Unclassified

In these systems, **unauthorized flows must be blocked** not only between users and files, but across applications and memory locations as well.

#### Covert Channel Protection
One of the major goals of the Information Flow Model is to identify and eliminate **covert channels**:
- **Timing channels**: Use CPU cycles or response timing to leak information
- **Storage channels**: Use shared storage (like unused file space) to send messages covertly

| Feature              | Description                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flow Control         | Restricts how information is transmitted                                 |
| Time-State Linking   | Ensures historical consistency in object versions                        |
| Covert Channel Mitigation | Blocks unintended communication paths (timing, storage, etc.)     |

#### Summary
- Focuses on **data movement**, not just access rights
- Prevents information leakage in high-assurance systems
- Evaluates both **direct and indirect** flows of information
- Vital in **military, government, and cloud environments**

üß† **Mnemonic**:  
"**Flow = Control + Class + Channels**"  
Control the flow, respect the classification, and close the channels.

### Noninterference Model
The **Noninterference Model** is a formal security model that ensures actions taken at a **higher security level do not affect** what can be seen or inferred at a **lower level**. It aims to **prevent information leakage** and maintain strict **isolation between security domains**.

#### Core Concept
Noninterference prevents **unauthorized subjects** from learning about **sensitive activities** by observing system behavior.

- **High-level actions** (e.g., classified operations) must **not influence** what is visible or perceivable by low-level users.
- Focuses on **behavioral isolation** rather than access rights.

üìå **CISSP Insight**: It‚Äôs not just about blocking access‚Äîit's about ensuring that **low-level users can't detect even the existence** of higher-level actions.

#### Example Scenario
Imagine a **multilevel secure system**:
- A user at **Top Secret** deletes a file or runs a program.
- A user at **Unclassified** should **not observe** slower system performance, changes in file counts, or log updates that imply something happened.

üõ°Ô∏è **Goal**: No **observable side effects** or interference across clearance boundaries.

#### Key Features
| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Behavioral Isolation     | Prevents lower-level subjects from detecting high-level activities          |
| Covert Channel Blocking  | Eliminates unintended communication paths (e.g., timing or storage leaks)   |
| Inference Protection     | Stops users from deducing secret information based on indirect evidence     |

#### Application Areas
- **Operating Systems**: Prevent cross-process leaks
- **Virtualization**: Keep tenants isolated in cloud environments
- **Military Systems**: Enforce absolute classification integrity

üîê **Real-World Example**:
In a virtualized environment, if a tenant on VM1 can detect performance changes due to VM2‚Äôs classified activity, the system violates noninterference.

#### Difference from Information Flow Model
| Model                   | Focus                                  | Security Goal                        |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Information Flow       | Direction and type of data flow        | Prevent data leaks across boundaries |
| Noninterference        | Side effects and visibility of actions | Prevent inference and covert signals |

#### Summary
- **Noninterference = No influence** across security levels.
- Ensures that **low-level users remain unaware** of high-level operations.
- Critical in systems where **covert inference** could compromise sensitive data.
- Supports **military-grade** and **cloud tenant isolation** requirements.

üß† **CISSP Exam Tip**: Understand how this model goes beyond traditional access control to **block inference and indirect disclosure**.

### Composition Theories
**Composition Theories** describe how security properties are preserved when multiple systems are combined. These models are critical for ensuring that **secure individual components** continue to behave securely when **integrated** into larger systems.

üìå **CISSP Insight**: When two secure systems interact, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee that the combination is secure unless the **compositional logic** is explicitly verified.

#### Core Objective
To understand how **inputs and outputs** from different systems affect each other and whether **security violations** may occur in the resulting composite system.

#### Three Types of Composition Theories
| Theory      | Description                                                                                       | Example Use Case                              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Cascading** | Output from one system becomes input to the next system.                                           | Secure printer logs passed to a monitoring system |
| **Feedback**  | Two systems exchange inputs and outputs in a circular or bidirectional way.                       | Identity provider (IdP) authenticates a user, then user action changes the IdP's behavior |
| **Hookup**    | Multiple systems send inputs to a single system or external entity.                              | IoT devices sending telemetry data to a centralized server |

#### Application Contexts
- **Multisystem environments**
- **Security architecture design**
- **Interconnected enterprise networks**
- **Federated systems and cloud service chaining**

üîó **Security Concern**:
Even if each system follows its own security policy, the combined flow of information or trust between them may introduce **unexpected pathways**, **inference risks**, or **covert channels**.

#### Key Challenges
- **Maintaining consistent security levels** across system boundaries
- Avoiding **leakage of sensitive data** in transit
- Preventing **downgrade attacks** between trusted/untrusted domains

#### Comparison with Other Models
| Model                  | Focus                              | Application                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Composition Theories   | Integration of secure systems      | Evaluating overall system security            |
| State Machine Model    | Security through state transitions | Secure boot, transition validation           |
| Noninterference Model  | Isolation of high/low levels       | Preventing influence between domains         |

#### Summary
- Composition theories help assess the **cumulative security** of interconnected systems.
- Cascading, Feedback, and Hookup are the primary models.
- Useful in cloud, hybrid, and cross-domain architectures.
- Failure to evaluate system composition can result in **systemic vulnerabilities**.

üß† **CISSP Exam Tip**: Know the **difference between the three composition types**, and understand **why secure individual systems may still pose risks when integrated**.

### Take-Grant Model
The **Take-Grant Model** is a graph-based access control model that focuses on how **rights can be transferred** between subjects and objects in a system. It‚Äôs designed to analyze the **distribution and flow of access permissions** and determine how rights may **leak or propagate**.

üìå **CISSP Insight**: This model is especially useful for evaluating **how permissions spread** over time in a system and for identifying **potential unauthorized access** scenarios.

#### Core Components
- **Subjects**: Active entities (e.g., users, processes) capable of performing actions.
- **Objects**: Passive entities (e.g., files, devices) being accessed.
- **Rights**: Access permissions (e.g., read, write, execute, own).
- **Graph Structure**: Represents entities as nodes and rights as directed edges between them.

#### Four Primary Rules

| Rule        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Take**    | A subject can take rights from another subject or object.                   |
| **Grant**   | A subject can grant its rights to another subject or object.                |
| **Create**  | A subject can create new objects or subjects and assign rights to them.     |
| **Remove**  | A subject can remove rights it holds or has assigned to others.             |

üìå Think of **"take"** as pulling a permission from another entity, and **"grant"** as giving what you already have.

#### Graph Representation
The model uses a **directed graph** to illustrate who can do what:

- **Nodes** = Subjects or objects
- **Edges** = Access rights (e.g., read, write, take, grant)

This graph can be **traversed** to determine if a subject can eventually gain a specific access right to an object‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs not directly assigned.

#### Practical Implications
- Shows **how access control permissions evolve**.
- Useful in **analyzing inheritance**, such as group permissions in operating systems.
- Helps **identify potential for privilege escalation** and **permission leakage**.

üîí **Security Analysis Use Case**:
Use the take-grant model to determine if a low-privilege user could gain high-level access through chained take/grant operations.

#### Comparison with Other Models
| Model              | Focus                              | Notes                                                 |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Take-Grant         | Permission transfer and propagation| Ideal for modeling how rights spread or leak          |
| Bell-LaPadula      | Confidentiality                    | Prevents unauthorized read/write based on classification |
| Biba               | Integrity                          | Prevents data contamination through improper writes   |
| Access Control Matrix | Static access permissions       | Maps subject-object rights but doesn‚Äôt model flow     |

#### Summary
- The Take-Grant Model is a **dynamic access control model** showing how rights are acquired or transferred.
- It is based on four rules: **take, grant, create, and remove**.
- Helps identify **privilege escalation paths** and **right leakage**.
- Represented using a **directed graph**, which makes it easy to trace rights.
- Particularly relevant for **evaluating trust** and **access path control**.

üß† **CISSP Exam Tip**: Understand how the model visualizes **access propagation**, and how the **take** and **grant** rules work to **change permissions over time**.

### Access Control Matrix
The **Access Control Matrix** is a foundational model for defining and enforcing **access rights** in a system. It provides a **tabular representation** of subjects, objects, and the rights subjects have over objects. This model is useful for understanding the **static allocation of permissions** in discretionary access control (DAC), role-based access control (RBAC), or mandatory access control (MAC) systems.

#### Structure of the Matrix
- **Subjects**: Users, processes, or entities that request access.
- **Objects**: Files, devices, databases, or resources that require protection.
- **Permissions**: The allowed operations (e.g., read, write, execute, delete).

Each cell in the matrix defines **what action(s) a subject can perform on a specific object**.

|           | File A      | Printer      | Network Share |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Alice     | Read, Write | No Access    | Read           |
| Bob       | Read        | Print        | Read, Write    |
| Charlie   | No Access   | Print, Admin | Full Control   |

üìå **CISSP Insight**: An access control matrix is a **conceptual framework**, not necessarily implemented as a literal table due to scalability concerns.

#### Two Derivative Structures
To optimize real-world implementation, systems derive two structures from the matrix:

1. **Access Control List (ACL)**
   - Object-centric
   - Lists all subjects and their permissions for a given object
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     File A: Alice - Read, Write; Bob - Read
     ```

2. **Capability List**
   - Subject-centric
   - Lists all objects and the permissions the subject has
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Bob: File A - Read; Printer - Print; Share - Read/Write
     ```

| Comparison       | Access Control List (ACL)               | Capability List                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Focus            | Objects                                 | Subjects                                 |
| Use Case         | Common in filesystems (e.g., NTFS)      | Rarely used directly; academic value     |
| Management Ease  | Easier for resource owners              | Harder to revoke per object              |

#### Advantages
- Simple and intuitive structure
- Provides **complete visibility** of access relationships
- Supports a wide range of access models (DAC, RBAC, MAC)

#### Limitations
- **Scalability**: Becomes unwieldy in systems with many users and resources.
- **Management Overhead**: Maintaining the matrix manually is inefficient.
- **Revocation Complexity** (with capabilities): Requires tracking individual subjects.

#### Use in Security Models
- Common in **DAC** systems where permissions are user-assigned.
- Foundational to **RBAC**, with roles acting as abstracted subjects.
- Can be extended to enforce **MAC**, where object labels and subject clearances drive access.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Know the difference between an **ACL (object-focused)** and a **capability list (subject-focused)**. Questions often test your ability to identify their correct use and management implications.

#### Summary
- The Access Control Matrix models subject-object-permission relationships.
- It can be broken into ACLs (per-object) and capability lists (per-subject).
- Widely used to support various access control models.
- Helps assess **who has access to what**, ensuring **principle of least privilege**.

| Concept             | Description                                         |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Access Control Matrix | Tabular view of access rights between users and objects |
| ACL                 | Object-based permission list                        |
| Capability List     | Subject-based permission list                       |

### Bell‚ÄìLaPadula Model
The **Bell‚ÄìLaPadula (BLP) model** is one of the earliest and most influential **confidentiality-focused security models**, developed for the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s. It is a **state machine model** designed to enforce access controls in a **multilevel security (MLS)** system.

#### Core Focus
- **Primary Goal**: Protect **confidentiality** of information
- Does **not** address **integrity** or **availability**
- Enforces strict access restrictions based on **security clearances** and **object classifications**

#### Key Properties
The Bell‚ÄìLaPadula model enforces **three major properties** to prevent information leakage between different security levels:

| Property                         | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Security Property**     | "No Read Up" (ss-property): A subject cannot read data at a higher security level |
| *** (Star) Property**            | "No Write Down" (*-property): A subject cannot write data to a lower security level |
| **Discretionary Security Property** | Access is governed by an Access Control Matrix (DAC-like)               |

üìå **CISSP Insight**: These rules prevent **data leaks** from higher to lower levels (e.g., from ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù to ‚ÄúConfidential‚Äù).

#### Example Scenario
If Alice has a "Confidential" clearance:
- ‚úÖ Can read ‚ÄúConfidential‚Äù and ‚ÄúUnclassified‚Äù files
- ‚ùå Cannot read ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù or ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù
- ‚úÖ Can write to ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù or ‚ÄúTop Secret‚Äù
- ‚ùå Cannot write to ‚ÄúUnclassified‚Äù (to prevent leaking sensitive data)

#### Trusted Subjects
A **trusted subject** is **exempt** from the *-property and may write down (e.g., declassification tasks).
- Example: A system administrator trusted to transfer data between levels securely

‚ö†Ô∏è **Exam Tip**: Trusted subjects must be carefully validated‚Äîthis is often exploited in real-world breaches.

#### Multilevel Security (MLS) Systems
BLP supports **compartmentalization** of data by clearance levels:
- "Top Secret"
- "Secret"
- "Confidential"
- "Unclassified"

MLS enforces need-to-know and **mandatory access control (MAC)**.

#### Lattice-Based Access Control
BLP operates within a **lattice model**, where:
- Each object and subject is assigned a **security label**
- Labels are hierarchically ordered
- Access is granted only if subject‚Äôs label **dominates** the object‚Äôs label

#### Diagram Summary
Bell-LaPadula Security Rules:
+----------------------+
| Simple Security: |
| No Read Up (NRU) |
+----------------------+
| Star Property: |
| No Write Down (NWD)|
+----------------------+

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
| Strengths                             | Weaknesses                                |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Enforces strong confidentiality       | Does not address **integrity** or **availability** |
| Prevents data leaks across levels     | Does not prevent **covert channels**       |
| Formally proven and widely referenced | Not suitable for commercial integrity use cases |

#### Summary
- Bell‚ÄìLaPadula is a **mandatory access control** model emphasizing **confidentiality**
- Based on **multilevel security labels**
- Uses three properties: **Simple Security, * (Star), and Discretionary Security**
- Basis for many government and defense systems

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: If the question is about **confidentiality** or **government data classifications**, Bell‚ÄìLaPadula is likely the correct model.

| Term                        | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Security Property     | No Read Up ‚Äî prevents subjects from reading more classified data |
| * (Star) Property            | No Write Down ‚Äî prevents leaking to lower levels |
| Discretionary Security Property | Matrix-based control similar to DAC          |
| Trusted Subject              | May bypass *-property under strict trust rules  |

### Biba Model
The **Biba model** is a **state machine-based security model** that emphasizes **integrity** rather than confidentiality. It was developed as the inverse of the **Bell‚ÄìLaPadula model** and is used to ensure that data remains **accurate, trustworthy, and uncorrupted**.

#### Core Focus
- **Primary Goal**: Maintain **data integrity**
- Designed to **prevent unauthorized or untrusted modifications** of data
- Applicable in **commercial**, **financial**, and **medical** environments where data accuracy is critical

üß† **CISSP Insight**: If the concern is about data being **tampered with or altered**, the Biba model is applicable.

#### Key Properties
| Property                      | Description                                                      |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Integrity Property** | "No Read Down": A subject **cannot read** data at a lower integrity level |
| **Star (*) Integrity Property** | "No Write Up": A subject **cannot write** to a higher integrity level   |
| **Invocation Property**       | A subject at a lower level **cannot invoke** (request services from) a higher-level subject |

üõ°Ô∏è These rules aim to **prevent data contamination** and **preserve trustworthiness** of information.

#### How It Works
- A **subject** (e.g., a user or process) can only:
  - **Read** data at or **above** its own integrity level (no read-down)
  - **Write** data at or **below** its own level (no write-up)

üìå **Analogy**:
- Think of integrity levels as **air purity levels**.
- You wouldn‚Äôt want **dirty air** (low integrity) to enter a **clean room** (high integrity).

#### Example Scenario
If Bob is a subject with "High Integrity" clearance:
- ‚úÖ He can **read** from "High" or "Very High"
- ‚ùå He **cannot read** from "Medium" or "Low" (No Read Down)
- ‚úÖ He can **write** to "High" or "Medium"
- ‚ùå He **cannot write** to "Very High" (No Write Up)

This ensures that **less trusted users or data** can't compromise **more trusted systems or records**.

#### Comparison with Bell‚ÄìLaPadula
| Model             | Focus          | Read Rule         | Write Rule        |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Bell‚ÄìLaPadula    | Confidentiality| No Read Up        | No Write Down     |
| Biba             | Integrity      | No Read Down      | No Write Up       |

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
| Strengths                                  | Limitations                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Prevents **corruption of high-integrity data** | Does **not address confidentiality**            |
| Applicable to **commercial environments**   | Assumes **external threats only**               |
| Useful in **auditing and accounting systems** | Does **not handle access control granularity**  |

#### Summary
- The Biba model is designed to **ensure data integrity**
- It is the **inverse** of Bell‚ÄìLaPadula
- Rules include **Simple Integrity**, **Star (*) Integrity**, and **Invocation Property**
- Useful in sectors like **finance**, **healthcare**, and **log management**

üö® **Exam Tip**: Biba = Integrity. Remember **No Read Down, No Write Up** ‚Äî ideal for protecting against **data corruption**, not data theft.

| Term                         | Description                                             |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple Integrity Property     | No Read Down ‚Äî prevent reading from untrusted sources  |
| Star (*) Integrity Property   | No Write Up ‚Äî prevent contaminating higher integrity data |
| Invocation Property           | Prevent lower-level processes from invoking higher-level processes |

### Clark‚ÄìWilson Model
The **Clark‚ÄìWilson Model** is a **commercial integrity model** focused on **ensuring well-formed transactions** and enforcing **separation of duties**. Rather than relying solely on labeling data, it controls how users can **modify data** through **authorized programs** only.

üß† **CISSP Insight**: This model enforces **integrity** by ensuring that users cannot directly manipulate data‚Äîthey must go through controlled interfaces.

#### Key Concepts
| Concept                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subject**                   | The user or entity attempting to interact with the system                   |
| **Program/Transformation Procedure (TP)** | The only approved method to interact with constrained data      |
| **Object / Constrained Data Item (CDI)** | The data that must be protected and maintained in a valid state  |

This creates a **triplet relationship**:  
**Subject ‚Üí TP ‚Üí Object**

#### Components
| Component                          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Constrained Data Item (CDI)**   | Data protected by the model; must be accessed via a TP                      |
| **Unconstrained Data Item (UDI)** | Data not yet validated; can be input from outside and must be transformed   |
| **Transformation Procedure (TP)** | Program that processes and transforms CDIs; enforces business logic         |
| **Integrity Verification Procedure (IVP)** | Routine that checks whether CDIs remain in a valid state           |

#### Principles Enforced
1. **Well-formed Transactions**:  
   - Data can only be modified through **authorized programs (TPs)**.
   - TPs are tested and approved to prevent violations of integrity.
   
2. **Separation of Duties**:  
   - Different users should perform different steps of a critical process.
   - Prevents fraud or unauthorized activity by ensuring no single person has total control.

üìå This makes Clark‚ÄìWilson ideal for **banking, accounting, ERP, and database management systems**.

#### Real-World Example
In a financial system:
- An **accountant** (Subject) can‚Äôt directly edit customer balances (CDIs)
- They must use a **TP** (e.g., a bank transfer app) that logs and validates the transaction
- An **IVP** checks all balances daily to ensure no unauthorized modifications occurred

#### Comparison: Clark‚ÄìWilson vs. Biba

| Integrity Focus        | Commercial integrity                      | Military-style multilevel integrity    |
| Labels?                | No (uses programs and rules)              | Yes (uses classification levels)       |
| Enforcement Mechanism  | Through TPs and IVPs                      | Through read/write restrictions        |
| Real-World Alignment   | Highly practical (used in real business)  | More theoretical                       |

#### Summary
- Clark‚ÄìWilson Model ensures **data integrity** through:
  - **Transformation Procedures** (only valid operations allowed)
  - **Separation of Duties** (no single person has total control)
  - **Constrained interfaces** (TPs act as gatekeepers)
- More applicable in **commercial environments**
- Enforces **trusted programmatic access** to critical data

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Remember the triplet:  
**Subject ‚Üí TP ‚Üí CDI** and the two principles:  
**Well-formed Transactions** + **Separation of Duties**

### Brewer and Nash Model
The **Brewer and Nash Model**, also known as the **"Coca-Cola model"** or informally the **Chinese Wall model** (now deprecated), is a **dynamic access control model** designed to prevent **conflicts of interest**. It ensures that access decisions **change based on a user‚Äôs prior activity**.

üß† **CISSP Insight**: This model is important for organizations like law firms, consulting firms, and financial institutions where handling multiple competing clients may lead to ethical issues or information leaks.

#### Core Objective
To prevent a subject (user) from accessing data that could result in a **conflict of interest**, particularly in **competitive business domains**.

> **Example**: A consultant working with Coca-Cola cannot access Pepsi‚Äôs data‚Äîeven if they‚Äôre authorized‚Äîif they've already accessed Coca-Cola's confidential files.

#### Key Concepts
| Term                      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conflict of Interest Class** | A group of companies or datasets that are considered competitors or in conflict |
| **Dynamic Access Control**    | Access permissions evolve during the session based on user behavior      |
| **Security Domains**          | Segregated groups of data that prevent cross-access                      |

The **access control policy** in Brewer and Nash **evolves based on the user‚Äôs actions**‚Äîa unique trait not shared with static models like Bell‚ÄìLaPadula or Biba.

#### How It Works
1. A subject starts with **no restrictions**.
2. Upon accessing data from **Company A**, a wall is created between that subject and **any data from competing companies** (e.g., Company B in the same conflict class).
3. Access to non-competing companies remains open.

> üìç This is enforced using **dynamic filtering** or **metadata tagging** to group datasets into conflict classes.

#### Real-World Use Cases
- **Consulting firms**: Prevent consultants from working with two competing clients simultaneously.
- **Financial firms**: Restrict analysts from making investment decisions based on conflicting interests.
- **Law firms**: Enforce ethical walls between clients in litigation.

#### Visual Representation
Subject accesses ‚Üí Company A data
‚Üí Conflict class triggered
‚Üí Access to Company B (in same class) = Denied

#### Strengths and Weaknesses
| Strengths                           | Weaknesses                         |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Dynamic, context-aware access      | Complex to implement and maintain  |
| Prevents ethical/legal violations  | Needs continuous policy enforcement|
| Flexible across multiple domains   | Doesn't address integrity or confidentiality directly |

#### Summary
- The Brewer and Nash Model is a **stateful**, **context-aware access control model** focused on **conflict of interest prevention**.
- Once access is made to one dataset, the model restricts access to **competing/conflicting datasets**.
- It‚Äôs dynamic, unlike traditional access models, and adapts in real time based on prior access patterns.

‚ö†Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**: Watch for keywords like "conflict of interest", "dynamic access control", and "ethical wall" on exam questions about this model.

### Disambiguating the Word ‚ÄúStar‚Äù in Models

The term **‚Äústar‚Äù** appears in multiple contexts in security literature, but it has **different meanings** depending on where it's used. It's important for CISSP candidates to understand these distinctions, especially in relation to access control models and security frameworks.

#### Star (*) Property in Bell‚ÄìLaPadula and Biba Models

In both **Bell‚ÄìLaPadula** and **Biba**, the term **‚Äústar‚Äù** (also written as `*`) refers to rules that **govern write operations** in multilevel security systems.

| Model              | Star Property ( * ) Meaning                | Security Goal        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Bell‚ÄìLaPadula      | **No Write Down**: Subjects can't write data to a lower classification level | Confidentiality      |
| Biba               | **No Write Up**: Subjects can't write to higher integrity levels              | Integrity            |

üß† **Key Rule**:  
- Bell‚ÄìLaPadula focuses on **confidentiality** (e.g., to prevent information leakage).  
- Biba focuses on **integrity** (e.g., to prevent untrusted data from corrupting trusted data).

#### CSA STAR Program

The **Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)** uses the acronym **STAR** to refer to its **Security Trust Assurance and Risk** program.  
It is **not a security model**, but rather a **cloud provider assessment framework**.

- CSA STAR = A program to improve transparency and trust in cloud services.
- Provides third-party audit reports and self-assessments to ensure compliance with best practices.

üîê **CSA STAR Levels**:
- Level 1: Self-Assessment  
- Level 2: Third-Party Audit  
- Level 3: Continuous Monitoring *(for future implementation)*

#### Galbraith's Star Model (NOT Security-Related)

Another unrelated model that uses the word "star" is **Galbraith‚Äôs Star Model**.  
It‚Äôs a **business management framework**, not a cybersecurity concept.

- Used to align company strategy, structure, processes, people, and rewards.
- Completely outside the CISSP scope ‚Äî **do not confuse with security models.**

#### Summary Table

| Use of "Star"     | Domain                | Meaning                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| *-Property (Bell‚ÄìLaPadula) | Access Control Model  | Restricts writing to lower classifications (no write down) |
| *-Property (Biba)          | Access Control Model  | Restricts writing to higher integrity levels (no write up) |
| CSA STAR                    | Cloud Assurance        | Security Trust Assurance and Risk program |
| Galbraith's Star Model     | Business Strategy      | Organization design model (non-security)  |

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**:  
The ‚Äú*‚Äù (star) **in Bell‚ÄìLaPadula and Biba relates to WRITE permissions**, not to general trust models or cloud certifications. Don‚Äôt confuse this with CSA‚Äôs STAR or other non-security frameworks.

## Select Controls Based on Systems Security Requirements
### Common Criteria

The **Common Criteria (CC)** is an **international standard (ISO/IEC 15408)** used to evaluate and certify the **security features and assurances** of IT products and systems. It was created to unify different evaluation standards like the U.S. **TCSEC** and the European **ITSEC** into a **global standard**.

#### Purpose of Common Criteria

- Provides **confidence** to buyers about the **security functionality** and **assurance level** of IT products.
- Allows **vendors** to demonstrate the **security claims** of their products.
- Enables **global recognition** of security evaluations across participating nations (e.g., U.S., UK, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, etc.).

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**:  
Know the role of **protection profiles**, **security targets**, and **EALs** in evaluating product assurance.

#### Key Concepts in Common Criteria

| Term                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Target of Evaluation (TOE)** | The product/system being evaluated                                       |
| **Protection Profile (PP)**   | Customer-defined security needs ‚Äî ‚Äúwhat is required‚Äù                     |
| **Security Target (ST)**      | Vendor-defined implementation claims ‚Äî ‚Äúwhat is provided‚Äù                |
| **Package**                   | Optional sets of functionality or assurance grouped for modular evaluation |

- The **PP** outlines desired features and protections.
- The **ST** shows how the vendor‚Äôs product meets the PP requirements.
- Matching PP ‚Üî ST helps buyers select a secure product.

#### Evaluation Assurance Levels (EALs)

Common Criteria defines **seven Evaluation Assurance Levels (EAL 1‚Äì7)** based on increasing rigor in development and testing.

| EAL  | Name                              | Use Case / Example                                                                 |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Functionally Tested               | Low-risk environments; basic confidence (e.g., home-use firewall)                  |
| 2    | Structurally Tested               | Legacy systems; commercial best practices                                          |
| 3    | Methodically Tested & Checked     | Medium assurance with documented development                                       |
| 4    | Methodically Designed, Tested & Reviewed | Most commonly used; strong assurance for commercial and government systems |
| 5    | Semi-Formally Verified Design & Tested | High security needs with formal methods                                           |
| 6    | Semi-Formally Verified & Tested   | Very high assurance; used for critical infrastructure                              |
| 7    | Formally Verified & Tested        | Highest assurance; rare, costly; used for classified/national security systems     |

üîê **Important**:
- Higher EAL ‚â† stronger encryption or zero vulnerabilities.
- EAL only measures **confidence in the implementation** of security functions.

#### Strengths of Common Criteria

- **International Recognition** via mutual recognition agreements.
- **Flexibility** through custom profiles and packages.
- Standardized and **transparent evaluation framework**.

#### Limitations

- Does **not evaluate real-world use** (e.g., admin controls, social engineering risks).
- Does **not assess personnel security**, **procedural controls**, or **physical safeguards**.
- May be **costly** and **time-consuming** for vendors.

#### Summary

| Feature             | Role in CC                                                                  |

üß† **CISSP Exam Tip**:  
You‚Äôre likely to see questions comparing **EAL levels**, **PP vs ST**, and the limitations of Common Criteria evaluations (i.e., what‚Äôs not covered).

### Authorization to Operate (ATO)

**Authorization to Operate (ATO)** is a formal declaration by a designated **Authorizing Official (AO)** that an information system is approved to operate with a defined **risk posture**. It is a key outcome of the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** process and replaces the older term **"accreditation."**

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**:  
Understand that ATO is not a one-time action ‚Äî it is **risk-based**, time-bound, and must be revisited after significant changes or incidents.

#### Purpose of ATO

- Certifies that a system has been evaluated for **security risks**.
- Acknowledges that the **residual risk** is acceptable to the organization.
- Enables systems to be deployed and used for **business or operational purposes**.

#### Authorizing Official (AO)

- A senior management figure who is **empowered to accept risk**.
- Reviews system assessments, vulnerabilities, and controls before issuing ATO.
- Can modify, revoke, or renew authorizations based on current threat landscape and system changes.

#### When is ATO Required?

- Before deploying new or significantly modified systems.
- When **operating in a regulated environment** (e.g., federal agencies, DoD).
- After significant:
  - Security **breach or incident**
  - System **upgrade or patch**
  - Change in **environment or function**

‚è≥ **Typical Duration**:  
Most ATOs are valid for **3 years**, but this can vary by organization or risk level.

#### Types of Authorization Decisions

| Decision Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Authorization to Operate**   | Risk is acceptable; system is approved for use                              |
| **Common Control Authorization** | Authorizes inherited controls (e.g., from shared infrastructure)             |
| **Authorization to Use**       | Allows use of third-party systems/services (e.g., cloud services)            |
| **Denial of Authorization**    | Risk is too high; system cannot operate                                     |

üìå **CISSP Insight**:  
**Reciprocity** is key ‚Äî if a system is already authorized under another AO, a new AO may issue an "Authorization to Use" instead of repeating the entire ATO process.

#### Relation to RMF (NIST SP 800-37)

The ATO process is part of the final stages of the **Risk Management Framework (RMF)**:
1. Categorize system
2. Select controls
3. Implement controls
4. Assess controls
5. **Authorize system (ATO)**
6. Monitor system continuously

#### Summary

| Component           | Description                                                                |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authorizing Official (AO) | Senior official accepting residual risk                              |
| Risk-Based Decision | Considers security controls and vulnerabilities                          |
| Validity Period     | Typically 3 years or until major change/breach occurs                      |
| Part of RMF         | Comes after assessment of controls; allows system deployment               |
| Decision Types      | Approve, deny, allow inherited control use, or third-party system use      |

## Understand Security Capabilities of Information Systems
### Memory Protection

**Memory protection** is a critical security feature enforced by the operating system to ensure that processes **only access the memory** allocated to them. It is a key component for maintaining **system stability**, **data integrity**, and **confidentiality**.

üß† **CISSP Exam Insight**:  
Improper memory handling can lead to vulnerabilities like **buffer overflows**, **data leakage**, and **unauthorized code execution**.

#### Purpose of Memory Protection

- **Isolates processes**: Prevents one process from reading or writing into another process‚Äôs memory space.
- **Protects the OS kernel**: Restricts user-space processes from tampering with kernel memory.
- **Supports multitasking**: Allows multiple processes to run simultaneously without interfering with each other.
- **Mitigates attacks**: Helps prevent exploitation techniques such as **stack smashing**, **heap spraying**, and **code injection**.

#### Key Techniques

| Technique                  | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Segmentation**           | Divides memory into logical segments (e.g., code, data, stack)               |
| **Paging**                 | Splits memory into fixed-size blocks, allowing fine-grained protection       |
| **Protection Rings**       | Separates user-mode and kernel-mode operations (e.g., Ring 0 vs Ring 3)     |
| **Virtual Memory**         | Provides abstraction of memory, isolating processes via unique address spaces |
| **Access Control Bits**    | Flags like read, write, execute permissions on memory pages                  |

üîê **Example**:  
Most modern systems use **hardware-enforced virtual memory** with **page-level access control**, where unauthorized memory access triggers a **segmentation fault** or **general protection fault**.

#### Memory Violations & Consequences

| Violation Type             | Result                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Buffer Overflow**        | Overwrites adjacent memory, enabling code injection                        |
| **Null Pointer Dereference** | Accesses invalid memory, causing crashes                                  |
| **Race Conditions**        | Allows attackers to manipulate shared memory in concurrent operations       |

#### Real-World Exploit Example

- **CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue)**:  
  Exploited a buffer overflow in SMBv1 on Windows. Lack of memory protection allowed arbitrary code execution ‚Äî used in the WannaCry ransomware attack.

#### Defense Mechanisms

| Defense Mechanism          | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DEP (Data Execution Prevention)** | Prevents execution of code in non-executable memory regions       |
| **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization)** | Randomizes memory layout to hinder exploitation      |
| **Stack Canaries**         | Inserts known values into stack to detect overflow attempts                |
| **Safe Libraries**         | Uses memory-safe functions (e.g., `strncpy()` instead of `strcpy()`)       |

üö® **CISSP Warning**:  
Failure to enforce memory protection leads to systemic vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit for privilege escalation or remote code execution.

#### Summary
| Concept               | Role in Security                                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Memory Protection     | Ensures process isolation and system stability                                   |
| Segmentation & Paging | Enable structured memory management with boundaries                             |
| Virtual Memory        | Provides process-level isolation                                                 |
| Protection Rings      | Enforce privilege separation between user and kernel                             |
| Mitigations           | Include DEP, ASLR, stack canaries, and bounds checking to prevent exploits       |

üõ°Ô∏è **Takeaway**:  
Memory protection is foundational to securing operating systems and applications. It enforces boundaries that prevent data corruption, system crashes, and code execution vulnerabilities.

### Virtualization
**Virtualization** is a security-relevant technology that allows multiple operating systems or applications to run on a single physical machine by abstracting the hardware. It plays a crucial role in **isolation**, **resource optimization**, and **testing** environments.

üß† **CISSP Exam Insight**:  
Virtualization is both a powerful tool and a potential attack surface. Understanding its benefits and risks is key for CISSP exam success.

#### Types of Virtualization
| Type                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Server Virtualization** | Hosts multiple virtual servers on one physical machine                     |
| **Desktop Virtualization**| Separates the desktop environment from the physical device                 |
| **Application Virtualization** | Runs applications in isolated containers                             |
| **Network Virtualization** | Abstracts and segments network resources virtually                        |
| **Storage Virtualization** | Pools multiple physical storage devices into a single logical volume       |

#### Key Components
| Component         | Role                                                                                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hypervisor**     | Software that enables multiple OSes to share hardware (Type 1 and Type 2)              |
| **Virtual Machine (VM)** | Emulated environment that acts like a separate computer                           |
| **Guest OS**       | The OS running inside a VM                                                              |
| **Host OS**        | The base OS running the hypervisor (in Type 2 virtualization)                          |

#### Types of Hypervisors
| Type           | Description                                | Example                        |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Type 1**     | Runs directly on hardware (bare metal)     | VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V |
| **Type 2**     | Runs on host OS like a regular application | VirtualBox, VMware Workstation |

#### Security Benefits
- **Isolation**: VMs are logically separated; a compromise in one does not affect others.
- **Testing & Sandboxing**: Safe environment for analyzing malware or running suspicious code.
- **Disaster Recovery**: Easy backup and restore of VM snapshots.
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of hardware by consolidating workloads.

üîê **Example**: Security teams often use VMs to run penetration testing tools or simulate attack scenarios in isolated environments.

#### Virtualization Risks
| Risk                            | Description                                                         |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VM Escape**                   | An attacker breaks out of the VM to control the host system         |
| **Hypervisor Compromise**       | Hypervisor-level vulnerability leads to total host compromise       |
| **VM Sprawl**                   | Too many unmanaged VMs result in increased attack surface           |
| **Snapshot Risks**              | Snapshots may store sensitive data that can be restored by attackers|
| **Insecure APIs**               | Poorly protected APIs used by virtualization platforms               |

üö® **CISSP Warning**: Hypervisor compromise is catastrophic. Ensure **minimal attack surface**, **patching**, and **segmentation**.

#### Security Controls
- Limit VM-to-VM communication (east-west traffic)
- Apply strict network segmentation between VMs
- Use **Secure Boot** and TPM for hypervisors
- Monitor virtualization management consoles
- Restrict administrative access to hypervisors

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

A **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)** is a dedicated hardware-based security chip designed to secure computing systems through cryptographic functions. It is primarily used to ensure **platform integrity**, perform **secure key storage**, and enable **device identity**.

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Insight**:  
Understand that TPM provides **hardware-based root of trust** and supports features like **BitLocker** and **measured boot**.

#### What is TPM?

- A **cryptoprocessor** embedded in a device‚Äôs motherboard.
- Defined by the **Trusted Computing Group (TCG)** standard.
- Performs secure cryptographic operations like:
  - Key generation
  - Secure storage of keys and hashes
  - Platform configuration measurements

#### TPM Functions

| Function                      | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Key Storage**               | Stores asymmetric keys in tamper-resistant hardware                         |
| **Platform Measurement**      | Records system state during boot process (measured boot)                   |
| **Attestation**               | Confirms that system hasn‚Äôt been tampered with using cryptographic proofs  |
| **Binding**                   | Encrypts data so it can only be decrypted on a specific system              |
| **Sealing**                   | Encrypts data and binds it to platform state; only accessible in same state|

üß† **Binding vs Sealing**:
- **Binding** = Ties data to a device
- **Sealing** = Ties data to both device **and** configuration (e.g., boot state)

#### Use Cases

- **BitLocker Drive Encryption**: Uses TPM to protect encryption keys.
- **Secure Boot & Measured Boot**: Verifies OS integrity at startup.
- **Credential Guard**: Protects sensitive login credentials.
- **Digital Rights Management (DRM)** enforcement.

#### TPM Versions

| Version | Key Difference                                          |
|---------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 1.2     | RSA + SHA-1; limited flexibility                        |
| 2.0     | Supports modern cryptography (e.g., ECC, SHA-256); used in Windows 11 |

üß† **Takeaway**:  
TPMs are **critical to platform security**, enabling trusted boot processes, secure encryption, and attestation. They are a **core component of modern endpoint protection** strategies.

### Interfaces

In information systems, **interfaces** define how users or systems interact with applications or components. From a security perspective, interfaces must be **constrained or restricted** to prevent unauthorized access and limit the functionality exposed to users based on their **permissions or roles**.

#### What Are Constrained Interfaces?

A **constrained interface** (also called a **restricted interface**) is a control mechanism that limits user interactions based on:
- **Role or privilege level**
- **Job function**
- **Context or environment**

üõ°Ô∏è **CISSP Exam Tip**:  
The **Clark‚ÄìWilson model** supports constrained interfaces by ensuring subjects access objects **only through trusted programs**.

#### Implementation Methods

| Method                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Menu Hiding**        | Options not available to the user are removed from the UI.                 |
| **Command Disabling** | Restricted options are visible but greyed out or disabled.                 |
| **Role-Based UI**      | Entire interfaces adjust dynamically based on the user‚Äôs role or context.  |
| **Input Filtering**    | Blocks certain commands or parameters based on access level.               |

#### Use Cases

- **Admin vs. Regular User Interfaces**: Admins can manage users and settings, while regular users are restricted to limited actions.
- **ATM Machines**: Interfaces only expose cash withdrawal and balance viewing; backend access is not available to public users.
- **APIs**: Enforced via API keys, tokens, or scope-based permissions to limit endpoints that can be accessed.

#### Benefits of Interface Restrictions

- Enforces **principle of least privilege**
- Reduces **attack surface**
- Prevents **accidental misuse** or misconfiguration
- Simplifies **compliance** with access control models

#### Example Scenarios

| Scenario                                 | Constrained Interface Result                                      |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Guest user logs into cloud dashboard     | Can only view billing info; cannot access compute resources       |
| Help desk operator uses admin tool       | Can reset passwords but cannot create/delete accounts             |
| Developer uses test environment API key  | Can read logs but cannot make changes to production systems       |

#### Related Security Models

- **Clark‚ÄìWilson Model**: Requires users to access data only through specific programs (transformation procedures).
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Roles determine what interface components are visible or accessible.
- **Discretionary and Mandatory Access Control** systems also support constrained access through permissions.

#### Summary

| Concept                  | Summary                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Constrained Interface    | Restricts UI or commands based on user‚Äôs privileges                     |
| Implementation Methods   | Menu hiding, disabling, RBAC-based views, input filtering               |
| Benefits                 | Minimizes errors, enforces least privilege, reduces attack surface       |
| Models Supported         | Clark‚ÄìWilson, RBAC, DAC, MAC                                             |

üîê **Key Takeaway**:  
Constrained interfaces enforce **access control policies** at the interaction layer‚Äîwhether it's a GUI, API, CLI, or remote service‚Äîensuring users only access what they are authorized to use.

### Fault Tolerance

**Fault tolerance** is the ability of a system to continue operating **without interruption** when one or more of its components fail. It is a key component of **availability** in the CIA triad and is essential for high-assurance systems, mission-critical operations, and disaster recovery planning.

#### Purpose and Benefits

- Ensure **continuous system availability**
- Prevent **single points of failure**
- Support **redundancy and failover mechanisms**

|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Automatic Failover** | Systems detect failure and immediately shift operations to backup          |
| **Manual Failover**   | Admins intervene to switch to backup systems                                |
| **Active-Passive**    | Backup node remains idle until needed                                      |
| **Active-Active**     | All nodes handle traffic; failed nodes are bypassed during fault           |

#### Availability vs. Fault Tolerance

| Concept         | Definition                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability    | The ability to access and use a system or resource when needed   |
| Fault Tolerance | The system's ability to continue functioning despite failures    |

#### Design Considerations

- Fault-tolerant systems must **detect**, **respond to**, and **recover from** failures quickly.
- Often include **health monitoring agents**, **watchdog timers**, or **redundant components**.
- Expensive to implement but essential for systems requiring **continuous uptime** (e.g., hospitals, finance, manufacturing).

#### Example

- A financial trading platform with RAID-6 disks, redundant NICs, dual power supplies, and clustered servers ensures that **transactions continue** even if a storage disk, network card, or entire server fails.

#### Summary

| Concept           | Summary                                                                 |

| Related Domains   | Disaster recovery, high availability, system resilience                 |

üß† **Key Takeaway**:  
Fault tolerance is not just a feature‚Äîit's a **strategic design decision** to ensure systems can withstand unexpected component failures without interrupting operations.

### Encryption/Decryption

**Encryption** and **decryption** are fundamental techniques for protecting data **confidentiality** and **integrity** in both storage and transit. Encryption transforms plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and key, while decryption reverses the process to reveal the original data.

#### Key Concepts

| Term           | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plaintext**  | Readable data before encryption                                              |
| **Ciphertext** | Unreadable scrambled output from encryption                                 |
| **Algorithm**  | Mathematical function used to encrypt and decrypt data                      |
| **Key**        | A secret value used with the algorithm to encrypt or decrypt the plaintext  |
